Charles Maung Bo (Burmese: ချားလ်မောင်ဘို, [t͡ɕʰál màʊɴ bò]; born 29 October 1948) is a Burmese Catholic prelate who has served as Archbishop of Yangon since 7 June 2003. He was created a cardinal by Pope Francis in 2015. Bo was born on 29 October 1948, in Monhla Village, Shwebo District, Sagaing Region, Myanmar to parents John and Juliana Aye Tin. Bo was baptized with the name Charles, as St. Charles Borromeo is his patron saint. Bo's father, a farmer, died when he was two. Thereafter, his local parish priest, Don Luwi, taught him the catechism between the ages of five and seven. He was sent to a Salesian-run boarding school in Mandalay, learning philosophy and theology from Father Giacomin Fortuanto. From 1962 to 1976, Bo studied at the Nazareth Aspirantate, a Salesian seminary, in Anisakan village, near Maymyo (now Pyin Oo Lwin). Bo was ordained a priest of the Salesians of Don Bosco order on 9 April 1976. He was appointed as prefect of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Lashio in 1986. Four years later, he was consecrated as the first Bishop of Lashio, preaching homilies in the local Kachin dialect, Maru. Bo also founded a new religious order, the Congregation of St. Paul's Brothers and Sisters, in 1990, dedicated to having "one vision of sharing the Good News of Jesus Christ with those who have not heard of him." In 1996, he was transferred to the Diocese of Pathein. On 17 March 2001, Pope John Paul II named him a member of the Pontifical Council for Interreligious Dialogue. On 24 May 2003, Pope John Paul named Bo Archbishop of Yangon. On 17 January 2009, Pope Benedict XVI named him a member of the Pontifical Council for Culture. On 4 January 2015, Pope Francis announced that he would make Bo a cardinal on 14 February of the same year. At that ceremony, he was assigned the titular church of Sant’Ireneo a Centocelle

Political Analysis: Cardinal Charles Maung Bo's biography suggests a moderate leaning with a slight tilt towards progressivism within the Catholic Church's political spectrum. His dedication to interreligious dialogue, as evidenced by his membership in the Pontifical Council for Interreligious Dialogue, and his engagement with culture through the Pontifical Council for Culture, indicate an openness to contemporary issues and an inclusive approach to pastoral care. These roles align with a more progressive stance on engaging with the modern world and fostering dialogue between different faiths and cultures, which is a hallmark of Pope Francis' papacy, who appointed him as a cardinal. Furthermore, founding a new religious order dedicated to evangelization reflects a dynamic approach to Church mission, suggesting a willingness to innovate within the framework of Church tradition. However, there is no explicit mention of his stance on hot-button social issues or specific reforms within Church governance, which might have warranted a more definitive score towards progressivism. Therefore, his overall political leaning within the Church context is assessed as moderately progressive, acknowledging his contributions to dialogue and evangelization while operating within the traditional structures of the Church.
