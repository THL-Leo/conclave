Peter Kodwo Appiah Turkson (born 11 October 1948) is a Ghanaian Catholic prelate who has served as chancellor of the Pontifical Academies of Sciences since 2022. He was president of the Pontifical Council for Justice and Peace from 2009 to 2017 and the inaugural prefect of the Dicastery for the Promotion of Integral Human Development from 2017 to 2021. Turkson was previously Archbishop of Cape Coast from 1992 to 2009, and was made a cardinal by Pope John Paul II in 2003. He has been viewed as papabile, a likely candidate for election to the papacy, both during the 2013 papal conclave which elected Pope Francis, as well as the 2025 papal conclave, which elected Pope Leo XIV. Turkson is an ethnic Fante and was born in Wassa Nsuta in Western Ghana to a Methodist Protestant mother and a Roman Catholic father. He is the fourth child of ten children. His mother sold vegetables in the open market while his father worked as a carpenter. He had a paternal uncle who was a Muslim. He studied at St. Teresa's Minor Seminary in Amisano and St. Peter's Regional Seminary in Pedu, Cape Coast, before attending St. Anthony-on-Hudson Seminary in Rensselaer, New York, where he graduated with an M.A. in Theology and a Master of Divinity. He was ordained to the priesthood by Archbishop John Amissah on 20 July 1975. Additionally, he earned a licentiate in Sacred Scripture from the Pontifical Biblical Institute in Rome in 1980. He returned to St Teresa's for a year, 1980â€“81, and became vice-rector at St Peter's Seminary in 1981. He also did pastoral work in a parish annexed to the seminary. From 1987 to 1992, he pursued doctoral studies in Sacred Scripture at the Pontifical Biblical Institute but his work on his thesis was interrupted by his appointment as archbishop of Cape Coast. On 6 October 1992, Turkson was appointed Archbishop of Cape Coast by Pope John Paul II. He received his episcopal consecration on 27 March 1993 from Archbishop Dominic Kodwo Andoh, with Archbishops Peter Poreku Dery and Peter Kwasi Sarpong serving as co-consecrators. He served as President of the Ghana Catholic Bishops' Conference from 1997 to 2005, and as Chancellor of the Catholic University College of Ghana beginning in 2003.[citation needed] John Paul II created Turkson Cardinal-Priest of San Liborio in his final consistory of 21 October 2003. Turkson is the first Ghanaian cardinal and was one of the cardinal electors who participated in the papal conclave of 2005 that elected Pope Benedict XVI, the papal conclave of 2013 that elected Pope Francis, and the papal conclave of 2025 that elected Pope Leo XIV.

Political Analysis: Cardinal Peter Kodwo Appiah Turkson's career and theological positions suggest a moderate leaning towards progressive within the Catholic Church's political spectrum, warranting a score of 0.3. His leadership roles in the Pontifical Council for Justice and Peace and the Dicastery for the Promotion of Integral Human Development indicate a strong engagement with social justice issues, a hallmark of more progressive elements within the Church. These dicasteries focus on issues such as peace, social justice, and care for creation, aligning with a more open and reformist approach to applying Catholic doctrine to contemporary problems. Turkson's academic background in Sacred Scripture and his pastoral work also suggest a balanced approach to Church doctrine and tradition, blending respect for tradition with an openness to engaging modern issues. His participation in the election of both Pope Francis and Pope Leo XIV, along with being considered papabile, suggests a level of respect and alignment with the current direction of the Church, which has been marked by a pastoral and inclusive approach under Pope Francis. However, without specific statements or actions directly challenging core Church doctrines or pushing for radical reforms, Turkson's stance appears moderately progressive, focusing on social reform and engagement with contemporary issues within a framework that remains fundamentally in line with Church teachings.
