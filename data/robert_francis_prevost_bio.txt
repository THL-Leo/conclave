(Robert Francis Prevost;[b] September 14, 1955) is the head of the Catholic Church and sovereign of the Vatican City State. Born in Chicago, Prevost became a friar of the Order of Saint Augustine in 1977 and was ordained a priest in 1982. His service has included extensive missionary work in Peru from 1985 to 1986 and from 1988 to 1998, where he variously served as a parish pastor, diocesan official, seminary teacher, and administrator. Elected prior general of the Order of Saint Augustine from 2001 to 2013, he later returned to Peru as Bishop of Chiclayo from 2015 to 2023. In 2023, Pope Francis appointed him prefect of the Dicastery for Bishops and president of the Pontifical Commission for Latin America, and made him a cardinal the same year. Robert Francis Prevost was born on September 14, 1955, at Mercy Hospital in Chicago, Illinois. His mother, Mildred Agnes (née Martínez) Prevost, a native of the 7th Ward of New Orleans, was from a Louisiana Creole family that had moved to the Chicago area; she graduated from DePaul University with a bachelor's degree in library science in 1947. His father, Louis Marius Prevost (July 28, 1920 – November 8, 1997), was a United States Navy veteran of World War II who first commanded an infantry landing craft in the Normandy landings and later participated in Operation Dragoon in southern France; he later became superintendent of Brookwood School District 167 in Glenwood, Illinois. Prevost has two older brothers, Louis and John. The brothers' paternal grandparents were Jean Lanti Prevost (1876–1960), an Italian man of French and Italian descent from Settimo Rottaro, near Turin, and Suzanne Fontaine (February 2, 1894 – October 10, 1979), a Frenchwoman from Le Havre. Their maternal grandparents were Hispaniola-born mixed-race Joseph Martínez, and New Orleans-born, mixed-race Louise Baquiet (also rendered Baquiex), a Black Creole.

Political Analysis: Robert Francis Prevost, exhibits characteristics that suggest a moderate leaning towards progressive within the Catholic Church's political spectrum, warranting a score of 0.3. Inspired by Pope Leo XIII, who is known for developing Catholic social teaching, indicates an inclination towards engaging with and potentially advancing the Church's stance on social justice issues. This inspiration suggests a respect for tradition coupled with a desire to address contemporary societal challenges, a hallmark of moderate progressives within the Church.

His extensive missionary work in Peru, including roles as a parish pastor, diocesan official, seminary teacher, and administrator, points to a deep commitment to pastoral care and social engagement, often associated with a more open approach to Church doctrine and governance. Such experiences in diverse and challenging environments may have shaped a worldview that appreciates the need for the Church to be responsive and adaptable to the needs of its flock, especially in marginalized communities.

Prevost's leadership roles, particularly as prior general of the Order of Saint Augustine and later as prefect of the Dicastery for Bishops and president of the Pontifical Commission for Latin America, indicate a blend of administrative skill and pastoral sensitivity. These positions require a balance between upholding Church doctrine and engaging with the complex realities of modern Catholic communities, suggesting a pragmatic approach to governance and doctrinal issues.

His background, marked by a multicultural heritage and significant international experience, especially in Latin America, likely contributes to a broader perspective on global and social issues, aligning with a more progressive stance on engaging with contemporary challenges facing the Church and society.

However, the absence of specific stances on hot-button issues (e.g., LGBT rights, women's roles in the Church, clerical celibacy) in the provided text prevents a classification of Prevost as strongly progressive. Therefore, his overall political leaning within the Church context is identified as moderately progressive, acknowledging his potential to foster dialogue and reform while respecting the Church's traditions.
