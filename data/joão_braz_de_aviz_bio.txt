João Braz de Aviz (Brazilian Portuguese: [ʒuˈɐ̃w ˈbɾaz dʒi aˈvis]; born 24 April 1947) is a prelate of the Roman Catholic Church. He served as the prefect of the Congregation for Institutes of Consecrated Life and Societies of Apostolic Life from 2011 to 2025. He began his career working for twenty years as a parish priest and seminary teacher. He became a bishop in 1994 and was bishop of Ponta Grossa from 1998 to 2002, archbishop of Maringá from 2002 to 2004, and archbishop of Brasília from 2004 to 2011. Aviz was born in Mafra, Diocese of Joinville, Santa Catarina, Brazil in 1947. He has four brothers and three sisters – the youngest sister has Down's syndrome. After pursuing his philosophical studies at the Major Seminary Rainha dos Apostolos in Curitiba and the Faculty of Palmas, he completed his theological studies in Rome at the Pontifical Gregorian University, where he obtained a licenciate, and at the Pontifical Lateran University, where he graduated in 1992 with a doctorate in dogmatic theology. Aviz was ordained a priest 26 November 1972. He began his ministry as a parish priest in the diocese of Apucarana, as Rector of the Major Seminary Apucarana and Londrina, and as professor of dogmatic theology at the Theological Institute Paul VI in Londrina. He was also member of the Council of Priests and the College of Consultors and General Coordinator of the Diocesan Pastoral Apucarana. As a young priest Aviz was once on his way to a village to say Mass when he stumbled upon an armored car robbery. He was caught in the crossfire and shot, with bullets perforating his lungs and intestines and one eye. He survived and surgeons were able to save his eye; he still carries fragments of those bullets in his body. On 6 April 1994, he was appointed to the titular bishop of Flenucleta as auxiliary of the Archdiocese of Vitória and received episcopal consecration on 31 May of that year. He was appointed bishop of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Ponta Grossa on 12 August 1998 by Pope John Paul II. He was promoted to archbishop of Maringá on 17 July 2002 where he served until he was appointed archbishop of Brasília on 28 January 2004. In May 2010 he organised the XVI National Eucharistic Congress, which coincided with the 50th anniversary of the city's founding. On 4 January 2011, Aviz, not a member of a religious order, was appointed prefect of the Congregation for Institutes of Consecrated Life and Societies of Apostolic Life.[a] He is the fourth Brazilian to head a Vatican department.[b]

Political Analysis: Cardinal João Braz de Aviz's biography suggests a moderate leaning towards progressive views within the Catholic Church context, meriting a score of 0.3. His extensive experience as a parish priest and seminary teacher, combined with his academic background in dogmatic theology from prestigious institutions like the Pontifical Gregorian University and the Pontifical Lateran University, indicates a deep understanding and respect for Church doctrine and tradition. However, his leadership roles, especially as the prefect of the Congregation for Institutes of Consecrated Life and Societies of Apostolic Life, position him within the Church's governance structures where he likely engaged with contemporary issues facing religious orders, potentially advocating for reform or modernization in the ways these institutions operate within the Church and society.

His survival from a violent incident early in his ministry and his personal family experience with a sister who has Down's syndrome may have influenced his pastoral care approach, potentially making it more compassionate and inclusive. These aspects of his biography suggest an openness to engaging with social issues and a pastoral sensitivity that might align with more progressive stances within the Church, especially on issues of inclusivity, social justice, and the role of the Church in addressing contemporary societal challenges.

However, the absence of explicit positions on hot-button issues (e.g., LGBTQ+ rights, women's roles in the Church, celibacy for priests) in the provided text prevents a full tilt towards a more progressive score. His academic and theological background, combined with his rise through the Church's hierarchical and governance structures, also implies a balance between tradition and reform. Therefore, while leaning towards progressive, he appears to maintain a moderate stance, integrating respect for tradition with a potentially open approach to contemporary challenges and reforms within the Church.
