Orani João Tempesta O.Cist. (pronounced [oɾɐˈni ʒuˈɐ̃w tẽˈpɛʃtɐ, - ˈʒwɐ̃w -]; born 23 June 1950) is a Brazilian prelate of the Catholic Church who has been archbishop of Rio de Janeiro since 2009. He was previously bishop of São José do Rio Preto from 1997 to 2004 and archbishop of Belém do Pará from 2004 to 2009. Tempesta was born in São José do Rio Pardo in the State of São Paulo. He is the youngest son of the Italian immigrant Achille Tempesta and his Brazilian wife Maria de Oliveira. After completing his elementary and lower secondary-school studies in São José do Rio Pardo, Tempesta entered the Cistercian Monastery of São Bernardo in the same city in 1967. He studied philosophy at the Monastery of São Bento (St. Benedict) in São Paulo, and theology at the Salesian Theological Institute of Pope Pius IX in São Paulo. Tempesta made his religious profession as a monk on 2 February 1969 and was ordained a priest on 7 December 1974. He was appointed prior of the monastery in 1984, while also acting as parish priest of the Parish of São Roque, as Diocesan Coordinator of Communications and Pastoral Care, and as professor at the Coração de Maria institute in São João da Boa Vista. In September 1996, when the Monastery of São Bernardo was raised to the status of an abbey, he was elected its first abbot. On 26 February 1997, Tempesta was appointed Bishop of São José do Rio Preto and received episcopal consecration on 25 April of that year. In addition he was Apostolic Administrator of the territorial abbacy of Claraval from 1999 until it was united with the Diocese of Guaxupé on 11 December 2002.

Political Analysis: Cardinal Orani João Tempesta's biography suggests a moderate conservative leaning within the Catholic Church context. His background as a Cistercian monk and his progression through the Church hierarchy, including roles as a parish priest and abbot before becoming a bishop and then archbishop, indicate a deep commitment to Church doctrine and tradition. The Cistercian order is known for its emphasis on monastic life and adherence to the Rule of St. Benedict, which suggests a traditionalist approach to spirituality and church life. However, there is no explicit mention of controversial or polarizing stances on social issues, Church reform, or engagement with contemporary issues, which might have indicated a more pronounced conservative or liberal position. His involvement in pastoral care and communications suggests an openness to engaging with the faithful in a contemporary context, hinting at a pastoral approach that balances tradition with some level of engagement with modern concerns. Without explicit evidence of radical positions or significant reformist initiatives, it is reasonable to infer a moderate conservative leaning, characterized by a commitment to tradition coupled with a pastoral sensitivity to the needs of the contemporary Church.
