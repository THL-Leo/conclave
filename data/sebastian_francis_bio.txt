Cardinal Dato' Seri Sebastian Francis (born 11 November 1951) is a Malaysian prelate of the Catholic Church. He has been Bishop of Penang since 2011. Pope Francis elevated him to the rank of cardinal on 30 September 2023. He is the second cardinal from Malaysia after Anthony Soter Fernandez. Sebastian Francis was born on 11 November 1951, in Johor Bahru, which was then part of the Federation of Malaya. His grandparents had emigrated to Malaya in the 1900s from Ollur in present day Thrissur district, Kerala, India. Francis entered Saint Francis Xavier Minor Seminary in Singapore in 1967 and enrolled in the College General, a major seminary in Penang, three years later, where he studied theology. At the age of 26, he was ordained a priest for the Diocese of Melaka-Johor on 28 July 1977. He was parish vicar of St. Francis Xavier in Malacca from 1977 to 1981 and then briefly parish vicar of Immaculate Conception in Johor Bahru. He then moved to Rome and earned a licentiate in dogmatic theology from the Pontifical University of Saint Thomas Aquinas in 1983. He was parish vicar of St. Francis Xavier in Malacca in 1984; professor of dogmatic theology and spiritual director at the major seminary of Penang, chaplain of university students in Penang, administrator of the Church of the Immaculate Conception in Paulau Ticus-Penang and pastoral coordinator from 1985 to 1988; vicar general of Malacca-Johor from 1988 to 2001; pastor of the Cathedral in Malacca from 1988 to 2004; diocesan administrator of Malacca-Johor in 2002-2003; parish priest of St. Louis in Kluang from 2004 to 2007; parish priest of the Immaculate Conception from 2007 to 2011; and pastor of Christ the King in Kulai in 2011–2012. He was vicar general of Malacca-Johor from 2003 to 2012. He interrupted his pastoral work to study at the Maryknoll School of Theology in New York where he obtained a degree in justice and peace studies in 1991. On 7 July 2012, Benedict XVI appointed Francis the fifth bishop of the Diocese of Penang. He received his episcopal consecration on 20 August 2012 at St Anne’s Church in Bukit Mertajam from Archbishop Murphy Nicholas Xavier Pakiam, with Bishops Antony Selvanayagam and Paul Tan Chee Ing serving as co-consecrators. His consecration was witnessed by 10,000 Catholics and attended by then Chief Minister of Penang, Lim Guan Eng.

Political Analysis: Cardinal Dato' Seri Sebastian Francis exhibits characteristics that align more closely with a liberal or progressive stance within the context of Catholic Church politics and theology. His educational background, particularly his degree in justice and peace studies from the Maryknoll School of Theology in New York, suggests an openness to contemporary theological approaches that emphasize social justice, peace, and the Church's engagement with modern societal issues. This area of study often correlates with a more progressive viewpoint within the Church, focusing on the application of Catholic doctrine to address and rectify social injustices and inequalities.

Furthermore, his pastoral work, including his roles as a parish priest, professor of dogmatic theology, spiritual director, and chaplain of university students, indicates a deep engagement with both the spiritual and temporal needs of his community. His involvement in education and pastoral care suggests a commitment to a living, contextual faith that responds to the current challenges faced by believers, aligning with a more progressive approach to pastoral care and ecclesial engagement with the world.

His appointment by Pope Francis, a pontiff known for his emphasis on mercy, social justice, and a more inclusive Church, further hints at Cardinal Francis's alignment with these priorities. Pope Francis's choices for cardinals often reflect a broader vision for the Church that includes a strong pastoral sensitivity and a willingness to engage with contemporary issues in a manner that is open and dialogical.

Given these factors, Cardinal Francis's political leaning within the Church is assessed as moderately progressive, reflecting a commitment to social justice, an inclusive approach to pastoral care, and a theology that is responsive to the signs of the times. However, without explicit statements or actions directly challenging core doctrinal positions, his score is not at the extreme end of the progressive spectrum.
