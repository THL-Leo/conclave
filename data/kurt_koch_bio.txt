Kurt Koch (born 15 March 1950) is a Swiss prelate of the Catholic Church. He has been a cardinal since November 2010 and president of the Dicastery for Promoting Christian Unity since 1 July 2010. He was the bishop of Basel from 1996 until 2010. Koch was born in Emmenbrücke in the canton of Lucerne. He studied theology at the Ludwig-Maximilians University in Munich and at the University of Lucerne, graduating in 1975 with a Doctor of Theology degree. He was ordained to the priesthood on 20 June 1982. Koch was appointed Bishop of Basel on 6 December 1995. He received episcopal consecration on 6 January 1996 from John Paul II himself, with Archbishops Giovanni Battista Re and Jorge María Mejía serving as co-consecrators. When a group of Swiss intellectuals and theologians called for John Paul's resignation on 20 May 2004, on the occasion of his 84th birthday, Koch described it as "disgusting and disloyal". In 2006, he supported the freedom of Muslims to build minarets in Switzerland, but also asked for greater religious freedom for Christians in Muslim countries. On 27 June 2007, Koch, along with several other Catholic prelates, attended a briefing from the Cardinal Secretary of State, Tarcisio Bertone, at the Apostolic Palace on Pope Benedict XVI's forthcoming allowing wider celebration of the Tridentine Mass.

Political Analysis: Cardinal Kurt Koch's biography suggests a moderate leaning with a slight tilt towards progressive views within the Catholic Church's political spectrum. His defense of John Paul II against calls for resignation shows a commitment to traditional Church authority and loyalty, indicating conservative elements in his stance on Church governance and doctrine. However, his support for the freedom of Muslims to build minarets in Switzerland, coupled with a call for greater religious freedom for Christians in Muslim countries, reflects a progressive approach to religious freedom and interfaith dialogue. This stance is further underscored by his role as president of the Dicastery for Promoting Christian Unity, suggesting an openness to ecumenism and contemporary issues of religious coexistence. His involvement in the briefing on the wider celebration of the Tridentine Mass under Pope Benedict XVI indicates a respect for traditional liturgical practices, yet his overall profile does not strongly align with either the conservative or liberal extremes. Instead, Koch appears to navigate a middle path, balancing traditional Church doctrine with a responsive attitude towards social issues and reforms.
