Daniel Fernando Sturla Berhouet[pronunciation?], SDB (born 4 July 1959 in Montevideo) is a Uruguayan Roman Catholic prelate and the archbishop of Montevideo. Sturla was born at the Italian Hospital of Montevideo on July 4, 1959, the youngest of five siblings. Raised in a middle-class family, he is of Italian and Basque-French descent. His father, a practicing Catholic and a lawyer by profession, had been a member of Catholic Action in his youth, whereas his mother, an agnostic, was brought up in a household with Batllist ideals. Both parents died during Sturlaâ€™s adolescence, leaving him in the care of his elder siblings and other relatives. He completed his primary and secondary education at Colegio San Juan Bautista, and his pre-university studies at the John XXIII Institute, run by the Salesians of Don Bosco. After graduating, he enrolled in the Faculty of Law at the University of the Republic. He entered the Salesian novitiate in 1979 and made his first religious profession on January 31, 1980. He studied theology at what was then called the Bishop Mariano Soler Theological Institute of Uruguay, and on November 21, 1987, he was ordained a priest. After his ordination he served as vicar of the Salesian novitiate and post-novitiate, director of the Salesian aspirantate, master of novices, director of the John XXIII Institute, and professor of Church history. He earned a licentiate in theology from the Soler Theological Institute in 2006.

Political Analysis: Cardinal Daniel Fernando Sturla Berhouet's background and activities suggest a moderate position within the Catholic Church, leaning slightly towards conservatism. His association with the Salesians of Don Bosco, an order known for its focus on education and youth work within a traditional framework, indicates a commitment to the Church's established teachings and pastoral care. His academic pursuit in theology and role as a professor of Church history further imply a deep respect for the Church's doctrine and tradition. However, the lack of explicit mentions of controversial social issues or reforms in the provided text suggests that Sturla may not actively push for progressive changes within the Church, nor does it indicate a staunchly conservative stance on such matters. His upbringing in a family with diverse religious and political backgrounds, including a practicing Catholic father and an agnostic mother with Batllist ideals, might have influenced a more nuanced approach to pastoral care and engagement with contemporary issues, allowing for a broader understanding and empathy in his ministry. Therefore, the score reflects a slight conservative leaning due to his traditional educational and religious background, with an openness possibly influenced by his family's diverse perspectives.
