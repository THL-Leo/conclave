Born in Omaha, Nebraska, Cupich was ordained a priest in 1975. He was named Bishop of Rapid City by Pope John Paul II in 1998. Cupich was then named Bishop of Spokane by Pope Benedict XVI in 2010.

He was appointed to the Congregation for Catholic Education in 2017. Blase Cupich was born on March 19, 1949, in Omaha, Nebraska, into a family of Croatian descent, the third of the nine children of Blase, a United States Postal Service letter carrier who later chaired the Sarpy County commission (1977–1988), championed Meals on Wheels and worked for the Society of Saint Vincent de Paul, and Mary (née Mayhan) Cupich, a homemaker. His paternal grandfather Blase Cupich, born in Donji Andrijevci near Slavonski Brod, immigrated to the United States as a teenager; his maternal grandmother Barbara Bahun, born in Donje Ladanje [hr] near Varaždin,[a] arrived in Nebraska in 1917, where she married Ivan Majhen from Karlovac, Cupich's grandfather. All four of his grandparents found jobs in the Omaha meat-packing industry. After receiving his initial education from the Benedictine Sts. Peter and Paul Elementary School in Omaha, Cupich attended Saint John Vianney Minor Seminary in Elkhorn, Nebraska, and then Archbishop Ryan High School in Omaha, Nebraska. He studied at Saint John Vianney Seminary at the University of St. Thomas in St. Paul, Minnesota, from 1969, obtaining his Bachelor of Arts degree in philosophy in 1971. After receiving his undergraduate degree, Cupich went to Rome to reside at the seminary of the Pontifical North American College. He attended the Pontifical Gregorian University in Rome, earning a Bachelor of Sacred Theology degree in 1974 and a Master of Theology degree in 1975. In addition to Cupich, his class at the North American College included ten future American bishops and two future cardinals: James Harvey and Raymond Burke.

Political Analysis: Cardinal Blase Cupich's biographical information suggests a leaning towards the progressive side of the spectrum within the Catholic Church's political context, which justifies a score of 0.7. Several factors contribute to this assessment:

1. **Papal Appointments and Influence**: Cupich's appointments by Pope Francis, a pontiff known for his relatively progressive stance on various issues, including social justice, the environment, and the need for pastoral care that reaches out to the marginalized, indicate an alignment with these priorities. Being chosen by Pope Francis as Archbishop of Chicago and later made a cardinal, as well as his appointments to significant curial positions, suggest that his theological and pastoral approaches are in harmony with the Pope's reformist agenda.

2. **Educational and Pastoral Background**: Cupich's education at institutions like the Pontifical Gregorian University and his multilingual ability point towards a broad, inclusive outlook conducive to engaging with a diverse, global Church. His pastoral care approach, inferred from his background and the roles he has been entrusted with, likely emphasizes dialogue, inclusion, and addressing contemporary social issues, aligning with a more progressive stance within the Church.

3. **Family and Cultural Background**: The emphasis on Cupich's family history, including their involvement in community service and their immigrant roots, may have influenced his perspectives on social justice and outreach, aligning him with more progressive views on social issues and the Church's role in addressing them.

While the text does not explicitly detail Cupich's stances on specific doctrinal issues, his trajectory within the Church under Pope Francis, his educational background, and his family's history of community service suggest a cardinal who is more open to reform and contemporary issues, aligning with a progressive outlook within the context of Catholic Church politics and theology.
