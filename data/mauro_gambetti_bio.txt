Mauro Gambetti, OFM Conv. (born 27 October 1965) is an Italian Catholic prelate who has served as archpriest of Saint Peter's Basilica, Vicar General for the Vatican City State, and president of the Fabric of Saint Peter since 2021. He was consecrated a titular archbishop on 22 November 2020 just before Pope Francis raised him to the rank of cardinal on 28 November 2020. A member of the Order of Friars Minor Conventual since 1992, Gambetti held senior leadership positions in the order beginning in 2009 and served as General Custos of the Sacred Convent of Saint Francis in Assisi from 2013 to 2020. Mauro Gambetti was born in Castel San Pietro Terme, Italy, on 27 October 1965. He earned a degree in mechanical engineering from the University of Bologna. He joined Order of Friars Minor Conventals in September 1992 and took his final vows on 20 September 1998. He obtained a bachelor's degree in theology at the Theological Institute of Assisi and a licentiate in theological anthropology at the Theological Faculty of Central Italy in Florence. He was ordained a priest on 8 January 2000 in Longiano. He was animator of youth and vocation ministry for Emilia-Romagna there and, from 2005 to 2009, also leader and animator of the religious community. In the spring of 2009 the members of the Bologna Province, who have responsibility for the convents of the Friars Minor Conventual of Emilia-Romagna, elected him to a four-year term as their superior. He held that position until 22 February 2013 when the leadership of the order appointed him to head the General Custody of the Sacred Convent of San Francesco in Assisi for a four-year term from 2013 to 2017, with the title General Custos. At the same time, the Bishop of Assisi appointed him Episcopal Vicar for the pastoral care of the Basilica of Saint Francis of Assisi and other places of worship run by the Friars Minor Conventual in that diocese. He was confirmed for another term as Custos General in 2017.

Political Analysis: Cardinal Mauro Gambetti's background and roles within the Catholic Church suggest a moderate leaning towards progressive views, though not to an extreme. His membership in the Order of Friars Minor Conventual and his leadership positions, especially as General Custos of the Sacred Convent of Saint Francis in Assisi, indicate a strong commitment to Franciscan values of poverty, humility, and care for the marginalized, which are often associated with more progressive stances within the Church. His academic background in mechanical engineering followed by theological studies, culminating in a licentiate in theological anthropology, suggests an openness to integrating contemporary knowledge and perspectives with traditional faith, a hallmark of moderate progressivism.

His pastoral roles, particularly in youth and vocation ministry, and his position as Episcopal Vicar for pastoral care, point to an emphasis on pastoral care and engagement with contemporary issues facing the Church and society. This approach aligns with a more open, dialogical stance towards Church governance and engagement with the world, characteristic of moderate to progressive church leaders.

However, there is no direct evidence in the text of explicit support for doctrinal changes or radical reforms within the Church, which would be necessary to classify him as strongly progressive. Therefore, his score reflects a moderate inclination towards progressivism within the context of Church politics and theology, balancing traditional roles and responsibilities with a forward-looking approach to pastoral care and engagement with contemporary societal issues.
