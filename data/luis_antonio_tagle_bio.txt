Luis Antonio Gokim Tagle (/ˈtɑːɡleɪ/ TAH-glay, Tagalog: [lʊˈwis ɐnˈtonɪo ˈtaɡlɛ]; born June 21, 1957) is a Filipino prelate of the Catholic Church, and the President of Interdicasterial Commission for Consecrated Religious since December 8, 2019. He previously served as the 32nd Archbishop of Manila from 2011 to 2020. Tagle is currently the Cardinal-Bishop of San Felice da Cantalice a Centocelle (pro hac vice) and also serves as the President of the Catholic Biblical Federation, Grand Chancellor of the Pontifical Urbaniana University, and as a member of various departments and dicasteries in the Roman Curia. He is often referred to by his nickname, Chito. Dubbed the "Asian [Pope] Francis", he is often seen as a representative of the Catholic Church's progressive wing. Since his elevation to the cardinalate in 2012, Tagle has consistently been considered as a Papabile or a potential pope-in-waiting. In the 2013 papal conclave—which elected Francis—Tagle was one of the contenders to become pope with his name floating alongside Jorge Bergoglio (Francis), Marc Ouellet, and Angelo Scola among others. In the 2025 papal conclave—which elected Leo XIV—he too was again a Papabile with his name floating alongside Pietro Parolin and Matteo Zuppi. Luis Antonio Gokim Tagle was born on June 21, 1957, in Manila, the eldest child of devout Catholic parents, Manuel Topacio Tagle, an ethnic Tagalog and his Chinese Filipino wife, Milagros Gokim, who previously worked for Equitable PCI Bank. Tagle's paternal grandfather, Florencio, came from Imus, Cavite; the Tagle family were from the Spanish, lowland Christian aristocracy known as the Principalía, which were the elite prior to the 1896 Philippine Revolution.[citation needed] The Tagle surname is originally Spanish, from the northern region of Cantabria). Florencio was injured by a bomb explosion during the Second World War; Tagle's grandmother made a living by running a local diner.[citation needed] After completing elementary and high school at Saint Andrew's School in Parañaque, Rizal in 1973, he was influenced by priest friends to enter the Jesuit San José Seminary, which sent him to the Jesuit Ateneo de Manila University. Tagle earned a Bachelor of Arts degree in pre-divinity from the Ateneo in 1977 and then a Master of Arts in theology at the same university's Loyola School of Theology. Tagle earned his Doctorate in Sacred Theology at the Catholic University of America from 1987 to 1991. He wrote his dissertation under the direction of Joseph A. Komonchak on "Episcopal Collegiality in the Teaching and Practice of Paul VI". Tagle also attended doctrinal courses at the Institute of Pope Paul VI University. In Komonchak's estimation, Tagle was "one of the best students I had in over 40 years of teaching" and "could have become the best theologian in the Philippines, or even in all of Asia" had he not been appointed bishop. Tagle has received honorary degrees from Catholic Theological Union and La Salle University. Tagle is a native Tagalog speaker and is fluent in English and Italian. He is also proficient in reading Spanish, French, Korean, Chinese, and Latin.
