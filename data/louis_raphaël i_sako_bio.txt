Louis Raphaël I Sako (Arabic: لويس روفائيل ساكو; born 4 July 1948) is a Chaldean Catholic prelate who has served as Patriarch of Baghdad since 1 February 2013. Pope Francis made him a cardinal on 28 June 2018. Sako was born in the city of Zakho, Iraq, on 4 July 1948. He comes from an ethnic Assyrian family of the Chaldean Catholic Church that has roots in a religious community that has had a presence in the city of his birth since the 5th century AD. He completed his early studies in Mosul and then attended the Dominican-run Saint Jean’s Seminary there. He was ordained a priest on 1 June 1974 and filled his first pastoral assignment at the Cathedral of Mosul until 1979. He then earned a doctorate in Eastern patrology at the Pontifical Oriental Institute. When denied a license to teach because he was only qualified for religious instruction, he earned a second doctorate in history from the Sorbonne in Paris. With this he secured his teaching license and was able to provide religious instruction. From 1997 to 2002 he was rector of the Patriarchal Seminary in Baghdad. He then returned to Mosul and guided the parish of Perpetual Help for a year. Sako speaks Neo-Aramaic, German, French, English, Italian, Kurdish and Arabic. A synod of the bishops of the Chaldean Catholic Church meeting in Baghdad elected Sako Archeparch of Kirkuk on 24 October 2002. Pope John Paul II gave his assent on 27 September 2003. He received his episcopal consecration on 14 November 2003 from his predecessor in Kirkuk, André Sana.

Political Analysis: Cardinal Louis Raphaël I Sako's biography suggests a moderate leaning towards progressive within the context of Catholic Church politics, meriting a score of 0.3. His educational background, particularly his pursuit of a second doctorate in history from the Sorbonne after being initially denied a teaching license, indicates a commitment to academic excellence and a broader perspective beyond strictly theological studies. This openness to secular academic achievement can be seen as a progressive trait. Additionally, his multilingual abilities and extensive education in both Eastern patrology and secular history suggest a cosmopolitan and inclusive approach to his ministry, further aligning with more progressive tendencies.

Sako's election as Patriarch of Baghdad and subsequent creation as cardinal by Pope Francis, a pontiff known for his relatively progressive stances on various issues, might also hint at a compatibility with the current papacy's more open and reformist agenda. However, the text does not provide explicit details on Sako's stances on social issues, Church doctrine, or specific reforms, which necessitates a cautious interpretation of his political leaning. The absence of explicit advocacy for radical changes or controversial positions leads to the classification of his leaning as moderately progressive rather than fully liberal. His leadership roles within the Chaldean Catholic Church, especially in regions facing significant turmoil and his focus on pastoral care, suggest a pragmatic approach to governance and engagement with contemporary issues, prioritizing the well-being and unity of the Christian community in challenging contexts.
