António Augusto dos Santos Marto GCC GCIH (Portuguese pronunciation: [ɐ̃ˈtɔniu ˈmaɾtu]; born 5 May 1947) is a Portuguese prelate of the Catholic Church. He served as the Bishop of Leiria-Fátima from 2006 to 2022. Pope Francis elevated him to cardinal on 28 June 2018. António Marto was born on 5 May 1947 in Tronco, a small village of roughly 500 population, in Chaves, rural Portugal. His family was traditionally Catholic, and of humble background. His father, Serafim Augusto Marto, was a Fiscal Guard and his mother, Maria da Purificação Correia dos Santos, a schoolteacher. António was the youngest of four siblings, two of which died before he was born at age 4 and age 6, respectively; the latter was crushed in a brutal accident when the axle of an ox cart broke on the way back from the grape harvest. The surviving sister married and had offspring. António was the product of an unintended but ultimately welcomed pregnancy. Despite coincidentally sharing his surname with the shepherd children of Fátima, Saints Francisco and Jacinta Marto, they have no familial relation; Marto's father came originally from the village of Santulhão, in Vimioso, instead. António Marto was very fond of the local parish priest, who he used to engage in conversation, and who left him with a lasting impression on how he was held in high esteem by the whole community. At age 10, following his primary school education, António unexpectedly expressed his desire to become a priest; he initially met some resistance from his father, who even though was devoutly Catholic, had envisioned a career in military for him and was planning to send him to the Institute of the Pupils of the Army. Joining seminary, he was a keen student (with some shortcomings in mathematics) and was also very keen on past-times such as sports (namely volleyball, basketball, handball, and field hockey) and theatre (where he was, ironically, found best suited to play the devil in popular morality plays). He started his Theology studies in Vila Real, but in 1968 the course was transferred to the Major Seminary in Porto, by decision of the bishop. He graduated at age 22, two years before the minimum age for ordination. Captivated by the spirit of the French worker-priest movement, and because of the then-prevalent idea that industrial-class workers had become largely disaffected with the Church, António Marto and two colleagues took up labour for a year in a metalworking factory producing parts for vehicle engines. This aided them in gaining valuable insights on the issues affecting working class masses and the world of trade unions.

Political Analysis: Cardinal António Marto's biography suggests a leaning towards the more liberal or progressive side of the spectrum within the context of Catholic Church politics and theology. Several aspects of his life and ministry contribute to this assessment:

1. **Engagement with the French worker-priest movement**: This movement was known for its progressive stance, emphasizing social justice and the importance of the Church's engagement with the working class. Marto's active participation and work in a metalworking factory to better understand and connect with industrial workers indicate a progressive approach to pastoral care and social issues.

2. **Pastoral care approach**: His biography does not detail specific theological positions that would align him with conservative elements within the Church, such as strict adherence to traditional doctrine or resistance to reform. Instead, his actions reflect a commitment to understanding and addressing contemporary social issues, suggesting a more open and adaptive approach to pastoral care.

3. **Background and personal experiences**: Coming from a humble, traditionally Catholic family and choosing to pursue priesthood despite initial familial resistance, Marto's background is rooted in a deep personal faith rather than institutional privilege. His early exposure to and admiration for the local parish priest, who was esteemed by the community, likely influenced his views on the importance of the Church's role in society, further aligning him with a more progressive stance on Church engagement and governance.

4. **Lack of explicit conservative indicators**: There is no mention of Marto advocating for strict adherence to traditional Church doctrine, opposing reforms, or taking conservative stances on social issues. The absence of such indicators, combined with his active engagement with the worker-priest movement and focus on social issues, supports a classification towards the liberal/progressive end of the spectrum.

Therefore, considering these factors, Cardinal António Marto's political leaning within the Church is assessed as relatively progressive, with a score of 0.7. This reflects his engagement with contemporary issues, a progressive approach to pastoral care, and an emphasis on social justice and the Church's relevance in the modern world.
