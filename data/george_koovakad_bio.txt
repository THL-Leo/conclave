Political Analysis: Cardinal George Jacob Koovakad's biography suggests a moderate leaning with a slight tilt towards progressivism within the context of Catholic Church politics. His role as prefect of the Dicastery for Interreligious Dialogue indicates an openness to engagement with other faiths, which is often associated with more progressive elements within the Church that prioritize dialogue and inclusivity. His involvement in organizing Pope Francis' overseas trips, known for their focus on issues like poverty, environmentalism, and social justice, further aligns him with a more open and somewhat progressive stance. However, there is no explicit mention of his views on contentious social issues or reforms within the Church, such as the ordination of women or LGBTQ+ inclusion, which prevents a classification towards the far end of the progressive spectrum. His educational background in canon law and his doctoral thesis on "The Obligation of Poverty for Secular Clerics in the Codes of Canon Law" suggest a strong foundation in Church doctrine and tradition, indicating that while he may be open to dialogue and contemporary issues, he likely maintains a respect for traditional Church governance and teachings. Therefore, a score of 0.2 reflects this balance between his progressive roles and actions within the Church and his grounding in traditional Church scholarship and governance.
