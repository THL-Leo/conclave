Political Analysis: José Tolentino Calaça de Mendonça's profile suggests a leaning towards the liberal/progressive end of the spectrum within the Catholic Church's context, meriting a score of 0.7. Several factors contribute to this assessment:

1. **Intellectual and Literary Contributions**: His engagement with modern Portuguese literature and his role as a Catholic intellectual, producing poetry, essays, and plays, indicate a person deeply involved in contemporary culture and thought. This engagement often correlates with more progressive views within the Church, as it reflects openness to dialogue with modern societal and cultural trends.

2. **Academic Background and Pastoral Care**: His academic pursuits, especially in biblical theology, and his pastoral work in various settings, suggest a balanced approach to doctrine that is both informed and compassionate. His progression from parish work to significant academic and then high-ranking Vatican positions indicates a capacity to blend traditional theological education with pastoral sensitivity, a hallmark of more progressive clergy who prioritize pastoral care over strict doctrinal enforcement.

3. **Positions within the Church**: His appointment as prefect of the Dicastery for Culture and Education and his involvement with the Pontifical Institute for Christian Archaeology point towards a Vatican role that is more about engagement with culture and education rather than doctrinal enforcement or governance. Such roles are typically associated with a more open, inclusive approach to Church engagement with the world.

4. **Membership in the Third Order of Saint Dominic**: While not exclusively indicative of a progressive stance, membership in a religious order, particularly one focused on preaching and teaching, suggests a commitment to a living faith engaged with the world's needs and questions, often aligning with more progressive approaches to theology and pastoral care.

5. **Pope Francis' Influence**: Being created a cardinal by Pope Francis, who is known for his more progressive stances on various issues, suggests alignment with the Pope's vision of a more merciful, inclusive, and outward-looking Church. This alignment further supports a more liberal leaning within the context of Church politics and theology.

In conclusion, while not at the extreme end of the progressive spectrum (hence not a full 1.0 score), Cardinal de Mendonça's profile suggests a clear inclination towards progressive views on Church doctrine, governance, and engagement with contemporary issues, underpinned by a strong pastoral and intellectual foundation.
