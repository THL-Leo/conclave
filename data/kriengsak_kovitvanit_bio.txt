Political Analysis: Cardinal Francis Xavier Kriengsak Kovitvanij's biography suggests a moderate conservative leaning within the Catholic Church's political spectrum. His education at the Pontifical Urbaniana University and the Gregorian University, both in Rome, indicates a solid foundation in traditional Catholic theology and spirituality, which typically aligns with a more conservative approach to Church doctrine and tradition. His roles in seminary leadership, both as vice-rector and rector, and his position as under-secretary of the Catholic Bishops' Conference of Thailand, suggest a commitment to the formation of priests within the traditional framework of the Church's teachings and governance. 

However, the lack of specific information on his stance on social issues, Church reform, or engagement with contemporary issues prevents a classification of him as very conservative. His appointment by Pope Francis, a pontiff known for his more progressive stances on various issues, as a cardinal could imply a level of openness or at least a non-adversarial stance towards moderate reforms or contemporary concerns within the Church. Additionally, his pastoral roles in various parishes indicate a dedication to pastoral care, which under Pope Francis has often been associated with a more compassionate and inclusive approach, though without explicit evidence of progressive views, it's prudent to maintain a conservative estimate of his leanings. Therefore, a score of -0.3 reflects a conservative but not extremely traditionalist position within the spectrum of Catholic Church politics.
