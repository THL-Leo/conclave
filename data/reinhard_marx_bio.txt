Reinhard Marx (born 21 September 1953) is a German Catholic prelate who has served as Archbishop of Munich and Freising since 2008. Pope Benedict XVI made him a cardinal in 2010. Born in Geseke, North Rhine-Westphalia, Marx was ordained to the priesthood, for the Archdiocese of Paderborn, by Archbishop Johannes Joachim Degenhardt on 2 June 1979. He had studied in Paris alongside future fellow Cardinal Philippe Barbarin. He obtained a doctorate in theology from the University of Bochum in 1989. On 23 July 1996, he was appointed Auxiliary Bishop of Paderborn and Titular Bishop of Petina by Pope John Paul II. He received his episcopal consecration on 21 September, his forty-third birthday, from Archbishop Degenhardt, with Bishops Hans Drewes and Paul Consbruch serving as co-consecrators. On 20 December 2001 he was named Bishop of Trier, the oldest diocese in Germany. On 30 November 2007 Pope Benedict XVI appointed Marx metropolitan archbishop of Munich and Freising, a position that Benedict held from 1977 to 1981.

Political Analysis: Cardinal Reinhard Marx is generally considered to be on the progressive side of the spectrum within the Catholic Church's internal politics, though not at the extreme end. His tenure has been marked by a willingness to engage with contemporary social issues and a pastoral approach that emphasizes mercy and inclusivity. Marx has been involved in discussions on topics such as the Church's approach to LGBTQ+ individuals, the role of women in the Church, and the need for reform in Church governance, especially in light of the sexual abuse crisis. His close association with Pope Francis, a pontiff known for his more progressive stances on various issues, further aligns Marx with the reformist camp within the Church. However, Marx's commitment to core doctrinal principles and his position within the hierarchy of the Church suggest a moderate progressivism that seeks change from within the institution, rather than radical overhaul. This is reflected in his balanced approach to tradition and innovation, aiming to adapt the Church's message to contemporary realities while maintaining its doctrinal integrity.
