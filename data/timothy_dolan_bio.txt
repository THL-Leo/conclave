Timothy Michael Dolan (born February 6, 1950) is an American Catholic prelate who has served as Archbishop of New York since 2009 and as a cardinal since 2012. Dolan served as the president of the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops (USCCB) from 2010 to 2013. After being made a cardinal by Pope Benedict XVI in 2012, Dolan participated in the 2013 papal conclave that elected Pope Francis and in the 2025 papal conclave that elected Pope Leo XIV. Dolan is seen as representing conservative values. He previously served as rector of the Pontifical North American College in Rome from 1994 to 2001, as an auxiliary bishop of the Archdiocese of St. Louis from 2001 to 2002, and as Archbishop of Milwaukee from 2002 to 2009. The eldest of five children, Timothy Dolan was born on February 6, 1950, in St. Louis, Missouri, to Robert (1925–1977) and Shirley (née Radcliffe) Dolan (1928–2022) . His father was an aircraft engineer, working as a floor supervisor at McDonnell Douglas. Timothy Dolan has two brothers, one of whom, Bob Dolan, is a former radio talk-show host, and two sisters. The family later moved to Ballwin, Missouri, where they attended Holy Infant Parish. Dolan exhibited a strong interest in the priesthood from an early age, once saying, "I can never remember a time I didn't want to be a priest." He would also pretend to celebrate mass as a child. Dolan entered Saint Louis Preparatory Seminary in Shrewsbury, Missouri, in 1964. He later obtained a Bachelor of Arts in philosophy degree from Cardinal Glennon College in Shrewsbury. Cardinal John Carberry then sent Dolan to reside at the Pontifical North American College in Rome while studying there. Dolan earned a Licentiate of Sacred Theology in 1976 from the Pontifical University of St. Thomas Aquinas in Rome. Dolan was ordained a priest at Holy Infant Church on June 19, 1976, for the Archdiocese of St. Louis by Auxiliary Bishop Edward O'Meara. After his 1976 ordination, the archdiocese assigned Dolan as an associate pastor at Curé of Ars Parish in Shrewsbury and Immacolata Parish in Richmond Heights. In 1979, the archdiocese sent Dolan to Washington D.C. to begin his doctoral studies at the Catholic University of America under Reverend John Ellis, concentrating on the Catholic history of the United States. Dolan's doctoral thesis centered on Bishop Edwin O'Hara of Kansas City; it was eventually published as a book.

Political Analysis: Cardinal Timothy Michael Dolan's biography suggests a leaning towards conservative values within the Catholic Church. His service as president of the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops (USCCB) and his elevation to cardinal by Pope Benedict XVI, known for his conservative stance on doctrinal matters, indicate a preference for traditionalist views. Dolan's roles in various capacities, including as rector of the Pontifical North American College in Rome and his participation in the papal conclaves that elected Pope Francis and Pope Leo XIV, further align him with the conservative wing of the Church, which often emphasizes adherence to established doctrine and tradition. His early life, marked by a long-standing desire to enter the priesthood and his engagement in traditional seminary education, coupled with his doctoral studies focusing on the Catholic history of the United States, underscore a commitment to the Church's historical roots and conservative values. While the text does not provide explicit details on his views on social issues, reform, or contemporary issues, the overall trajectory of his career and his positions within the Church hierarchy suggest a conservative political leaning within the context of Church politics and theology.
