Carlos Aguiar Retes (Spanish pronunciation: [ˈkaɾlos aˈɣjaɾ ˈretes]; born 9 January 1950) is a Mexican cardinal of the Catholic Church who serves as the Archbishop of Mexico City. He has served as an officer of the Mexican Episcopal Conference and the Latin American Episcopal Conference (CELAM) and been president of both. He helped draft the landmark mission statement CELAM issued at the close of its 2007 conference in Aparecida. He was archbishop of Tlalnepantla from 2009 to 2017 and Bishop of Texcoco from 1997 to 2009. David Agren of the Catholic News Service calls him a "longtime ally" of Pope Francis who combines "intellectual finesse with a pastoral passion". Aguiar Retes was born on 9 January 1950, in Tepic, Mexico, the second of six children. His parents were Carlos Aguiar Manjarrez and María Teresa Retes Pérez-Sandi. He studied Humanities and Philosophy at the Seminary of Tepic, graduating in 1969, and theology at the Pontifical Seminary of Montezuma in Montezuma, New Mexico, in the United States through 1972, and at the Seminary of Tula, Hidalgo, finishing in 1973. He was ordained a deacon on 24 December 1971. He was ordained a priest on 23 April 1973 in the Cathedral of Tepic. That year he began working as parochial vicar in the Parish of St. Maria Goretti, where he remained until 1974. He studied in Rome at the Pontifical Latin American College from 1974 to 1977, where he earned a degree in Holy Scripture from the Pontifical Biblical Institute. He returned to Mexico and was appointed rector of the Seminary of Tepic. In 1991 he returned to Rome to continue his studies. From 1992 to 1993 he was part of a team of biblical scholars who prepared the edition of la Biblia de América, a translation of the Bible into accessible language. In 1996 he completed a doctorate in biblical theology at the Pontifical Gregorian University, with a thesis "Criticism of the prophets fasting". Between 1996 and 1997 he held the chair of Sacred Scripture at the Pontifical University of Mexico, where he was also rector of the John XXIII Residence for Priests. In addition to Spanish, Aguiar is fluent in Italian, English, French and German.

Political Analysis: Carlos Aguiar Retes' biography suggests a moderate to slightly progressive leaning within the Catholic Church's political spectrum. His close alliance with Pope Francis, known for his relatively progressive stance on various issues, indicates a leaning towards reformist views. Aguiar Retes' involvement in drafting the CELAM mission statement in 2007, under a conference that emphasized social justice, the preferential option for the poor, and environmental concerns, aligns with a progressive approach to contemporary issues facing the Church and society. His academic background, with a focus on making the Bible accessible and his doctoral work on "Criticism of the prophets fasting," suggests an intellectual openness to exploring and reinterpreting Church teachings in a contemporary context. Furthermore, his multilingualism and extensive education abroad indicate a broad perspective, likely incorporating a wide range of views and a willingness to engage with the global Church. However, there is no explicit mention of his stance on hot-button issues like LGBTQ+ rights, women's ordination, or clerical celibacy, which prevents a classification as fully progressive. Thus, a score of 0.4 is appropriate, reflecting a moderate with leanings towards progressivism within the Church's political and theological spectrum.
