Sérgio da Rocha (Portuguese pronunciation: [ˈsɛʁʒiu dɐ ˈʁɔʃɐ]; born 21 October 1959) is a Brazilian prelate of the Catholic Church who has been a cardinal since 2016 and the Archbishop of São Salvador da Bahia since 11 March 2020. He has been a bishop since 2001, first as auxiliary bishop of Fortaleza from 2001 to 2007, coadjutor and then archbishop of Teresina from 2007 to 2011, and archbishop of Brasília from 2011 to 2020. He is a member of the Council of Cardinals. Rocha was born in Dobrada in the state of São Paulo on 21 October 1959 and grew up in a rural area. After his elementary studies in Matão, he took courses in philosophy at the seminary of the Diocese of São Carlos and theology at the Theological Institute of Campinas. He earned a licentiate in moral theology from the Theological Faculty Nossa Senhora da Assunção in São Paulo, and a doctorate in the same discipline from the Alphonsian Academy, Rome. He was ordained a priest in Matão on 14 December 1984. He worked as a pastor in the Água Vermelha neighborhood of São Carlos and was coordinator of Youth Ministry of the Diocese of São Carlos in 1985/1986; professor of philosophy at the seminary and spiritual director of the House of Theology in Campinas in 1986/1987 and in 1991; rector of the Philosophy Seminary in 1987–1988 and in 1990; coordinator of Vocational Ministry in 1987 and 1989; vicar of the Cathedral of São Carlos in 1988/1989; vicar of Nossa Senhora de Fátima parish in 1990; coordinator and rector of São Judas Tadeu Chapel in 1991; professor of moral theology at the PUC Campinas and rector of the Diocesan Seminary of Theology from 1997 to 2001. On the diocesan level, he was a member of the training team for permanent deacons, and a member of the Council of Priests and the College of Consultants. On 13 June 2001, Pope John Paul II appointed him titular bishop of Alba and auxiliary bishop of Fortaleza. He received his episcopal consecration on 11 August. He was appointed coadjutor archbishop of Teresina on 31 January 2007 and he became archbishop there on 3 September 2008.

Political Analysis: Cardinal Sérgio da Rocha's biography suggests a moderate leaning with a slight tilt towards progressive within the Catholic Church's context. His academic background in moral theology, particularly from the Alphonsian Academy in Rome, which is known for its focus on moral theology in the spirit of Alphonsus Liguori, points towards a commitment to addressing ethical issues in a nuanced and perhaps more pastoral manner. His active involvement in pastoral care, such as working as a pastor in a neighborhood, coordinating Youth Ministry, and focusing on supporting the homeless and young people during his tenure in Brasília, indicates a pastoral approach that is attentive to social issues and the needs of the marginalized. The establishment of 11 new parishes under his leadership could be seen as an effort to expand the Church's reach and accessibility, aligning with a more progressive stance on Church growth and engagement with the community.

Furthermore, his roles in education, both as a professor and a rector, suggest an openness to theological and philosophical education, which is often associated with a more progressive outlook. However, there is no explicit mention of his stance on controversial doctrinal issues or any radical reforms that would warrant a classification as strongly progressive. Therefore, his actions and background suggest a moderate approach with a leaning towards progressive, especially in terms of pastoral care and engagement with contemporary issues, but without significant evidence of challenging Church doctrine or tradition in a way that would place him at the far end of the progressive spectrum.
