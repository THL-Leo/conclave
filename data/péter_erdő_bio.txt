Péter Erdő (Hungarian: Erdő Péter, pronounced [ˈɛrdøː ˈpeːtɛr]; born 25 June 1952) is a Hungarian cardinal of the Catholic Church who has served as the Archbishop of Esztergom-Budapest and Primate of Hungary since 2003. He was president of the Council of the Bishops' Conferences of Europe from 2006 to 2016. He was the relator general for the Third Extraordinary General Assembly of the Synod of Bishops in Rome. Erdő was seen as a leading candidate in the 2025 papal conclave. He gained significant support and was the favored choice of conservative Catholic networks in the United States, Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán and has enjoyed good relations with the Orthodox churches and the Russian government. Erdő was born in Budapest on 25 June 1952, the first of the six children of Sándor and Mária (née Kiss) Erdő. He studied at the seminaries of Esztergom and Budapest, and the Pontifical Lateran University in Rome (where he attained doctorates in both theology and canon law) with a doctoral dissertation on the philosophical and theological foundations of canon law in the writings of Nicholas of Cusa. On 18 June 1975, Erdő was ordained to the priesthood by Archbishop László Lékai, and was incardinated in the Archdiocese of Esztergom. He worked as parochial vicar in Dorog, and then continued his studies in Rome from 1977 to 1980. For the next eight years, he taught as a professor of theology and canon law at the Seminary of Esztergom [hu], and held guest lectures at several foreign universities. Erdő served in the Hungarian Episcopal Conference as Secretary of the Commission of Canon Law in 1986, and later as its president in 1999. In 1988, he began teaching theology at the Pázmány Péter Catholic University, serving as rector from 1998 to 2003. Since 2005 he has been the Great Chancellor of the university. On 5 November 1999, he was appointed an auxiliary bishop of Székesfehérvár and titular bishop of Puppi. He received his episcopal consecration on 6 January 2000 from Pope John Paul II with Archbishops Giovanni Battista Re and Marcello Zago, OMI, acting as co-consecrators. Erdő was named Archbishop of Esztergom-Budapest on 7 December 2002, a post which carries with it the title of Primate of Hungary. Erdő became a corresponding member of the Hungarian Academy of Sciences in 2007 and a full member in 2013. In 2011, he was awarded an honorary doctorate by the University of Navarra (Spain). He was created Cardinal-Priest of Santa Balbina by John Paul II in the consistory of 21 October 2003. He was the youngest member of the Sacred College until the appointment of Reinhard Marx in 2010.

Political Analysis: Cardinal Péter Erdő's profile suggests a conservative leaning within the Catholic Church's political spectrum. His significant support from conservative Catholic networks in the United States and the favor of Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán, known for his conservative policies, indicate a traditionalist stance. Erdő's good relations with the Orthodox churches and the Russian government further align with a conservative approach, emphasizing ecumenism with traditionally minded Christian bodies. His academic background, with doctorates in theology and canon law, and his dissertation on the philosophical and theological foundations of canon law in the writings of Nicholas of Cusa, suggest a deep respect for Church tradition and doctrinal orthodoxy. His roles, including president of the Council of the Bishops' Conferences of Europe and relator general for the Third Extraordinary General Assembly of the Synod of Bishops, indicate a leadership style that likely values canonical and doctrinal fidelity. While the text does not provide explicit details on his views on social issues, reform, or specific theological positions, the overall evidence points to a conservative orientation in Church doctrine, governance, and engagement with contemporary issues.
