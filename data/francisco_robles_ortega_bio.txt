He was archbishop of Monterrey from 2003 to 2011. He was president of the Mexican Episcopal Conference from 2012 to 2018. Francisco Robles Ortega was born in Mascota on 2 March 1949, the third of sixteen children born to Francisco Robles Arreola (b. 1917) and Teresa Ortega de Robles (b. 1927). He studied humanities at the minor seminary in Autlán, philosophy at the seminary in Guadalajara, and theology at the seminary in Zamora. Robles was ordained to the priesthood by Bishop José Vásquez Silos on 20 July 1976. He studied at the Pontifical Gregorian University in Rome from 1976 to 1979, obtaining his licentiate in theology. Upon his return to Autlán, he held appointments as parish vicar, prefect of studies and spiritual director at the minor seminary, and chaplain of nuns. In 1980 he became rector of the seminary. He also served as diocesan consultor and president of the priests council and a member of the Commission for the Formation of the Clergy and of the Diocesan Commission for the Doctrine of the Faith. In 1985 he was appointed vicar general of the diocese and then became assistant to the commission for economic affairs of the diocese and taught at the seminary. He was named apostolic administrator of Autlán following the death of Bishop Vásquez Silos in July 1990.[citation needed] On 30 April 1991, Robles was appointed auxiliary bishop of Toluca and Titular Bishop of Bossa by Pope John Paul II. He received his episcopal consecration on the following 5 June from Bishop Alfredo Torres Romero, with Bishops José Hernández González and Javier Lozano Barragán serving as co-consecrators, in the Cathedral of Toluca.

Political Analysis: Based on the biographical text of Francisco Robles Ortega, several key factors suggest a conservative leaning within the Church context, though not at the extreme end of traditionalism. His educational background, with studies at the Pontifical Gregorian University in Rome, a prestigious institution known for its adherence to Catholic doctrine, and his progression through various ecclesiastical positions, including vicar general and apostolic administrator, indicate a deep integration within the Church's traditional structures. His roles, particularly as president of the priests council and a member of the Commission for the Formation of the Clergy and of the Diocesan Commission for the Doctrine of the Faith, suggest a commitment to maintaining doctrinal orthodoxy and clergy formation in line with established Church teachings.

Furthermore, his long tenure in various leadership positions, such as bishop of Toluca and archbishop of Monterrey, followed by his elevation to cardinal and his presidency of the Mexican Episcopal Conference, point to a level of trust and respect from both the Vatican and his peers, typically afforded to those who align with core Church values and governance models. However, the absence of specific mentions of controversial social issues or direct engagement with contemporary debates in the text prevents a full assessment as extremely conservative. Therefore, while Robles Ortega appears to lean conservative, particularly in his adherence to Church doctrine and governance, the lack of explicit evidence of engagement with polarizing issues or radical traditionalist stances justifies a moderate conservative score of -0.5.
