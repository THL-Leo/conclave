Rainer Maria Woelki (German pronunciation: [ˈʁaɪnɐ maˈʁiːa ˈvœlki]; born 18 August 1956) is a German Cardinal of the Catholic Church. He has been Archbishop of Cologne since his installation on 20 September 2014 following his election by the Cathedral Chapter to succeed Joachim Meisner in that position. He previously served as Archbishop of Berlin. Woelki was born on 18 August 1956 in Cologne, one of three children of parents who had been expelled from East Prussia at the end of the Second World War. He studied philosophy and theology at the Theological Faculties of the universities of Bonn and Freiburg im Breisgau. On 14 June 1985 Cardinal Joseph Höffner ordained him a priest for the Archdiocese of Cologne. From 1985 to 1989 he was assistant priest at St Mary's Parish in Neuss. In 1989, he served for a short time as military chaplain in Münster. In 1990, he became private secretary to the Archbishop of Cologne. From 1997 to 2011, he was Director of the "Collegium Albertinum", a residence for major seminarians of the archdiocese studying at the University of Bonn. In 1999, Pope John Paul II named him a Chaplain of His Holiness, with the title of Monsignor. In 2000, he obtained a doctorate in theology, with a thesis on the ecclesiological role of the parish, from the Pontifical University of the Holy Cross. On 24 February 2003, he was appointed Titular Bishop of Scampa and Auxiliary Bishop of the Archdiocese of Cologne by Pope John Paul II. He was consecrated on 30 March 2003 by Cardinal Joachim Meisner. He chose as his episcopal motto "Nos sumus testes" ("We are witnesses"), from Acts 5:32.

Political Analysis: Cardinal Rainer Maria Woelki's biographical details suggest a leaning towards the conservative/traditionalist end of the spectrum within the Catholic Church's political and theological context. His close association with Cardinal Joachim Meisner, a known conservative figure, as both a successor in the Archdiocese of Cologne and having been consecrated by him, indicates a continuity of conservative values. Woelki's choice of episcopal motto, "Nos sumus testes" ("We are witnesses"), from Acts 5:32, while not explicitly conservative, emphasizes a commitment to witnessing and presumably upholding the teachings and traditions of the Church. His academic and pastoral roles, including his directorship at the "Collegium Albertinum" and his service as a military chaplain, do not directly indicate his stance on social issues or reform, but his progression within the Church under the pontificates of John Paul II and Benedict XVI, both of whom were noted for their conservative stances on doctrine and Church governance, further aligns him with a conservative outlook. The lack of explicit mention of engagement with contemporary social issues or reforms in the provided text supports the inference of a conservative leaning, as more progressive figures in the Church are often noted for their active engagement with such topics.
