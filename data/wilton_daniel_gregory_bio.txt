Wilton Daniel Gregory (born December 7, 1947) is an American Catholic prelate who served as Archbishop of Washington from 2019 to 2025. Pope Francis made him a cardinal in 2020, the first of African-American descent. Gregory previously served as an auxiliary bishop of the Archdiocese of Chicago from 1983 to 1994; as Bishop of Belleville from 1994 to 2004; and as Archbishop of Atlanta from 2005 to 2019. Gregory was the first African-American president of the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops (USCCB) from 2001 to 2004. He led the USCCB in issuing the "Charter for the Protection of Children and Young People" in response to the sexual abuse scandal in the American Catholic Church. Wilton Gregory was born on December 7, 1947, in Chicago, Illinois, to Ethel (n√©e Duncan) and Wilton Gregory. One of three children, he has two sisters: Elaine and Claudia. Gregory's parents divorced when he was young, and his grandmother, Etta Mae Duncan, subsequently moved in with the family at their home on the South Side of Chicago. In 1958, Gregory was enrolled at St. Carthage Grammar School, a parochial school in Chicago. He later said that he decided then to become a priest, even though he was not a Catholic. At 11 years old, Gregory was baptized and received his first communion in 1959, and was confirmed by Bishop Raymond Hillinger later that year.

Political Analysis: Cardinal Wilton Daniel Gregory's biography suggests a leaning towards the liberal/progressive end of the spectrum within the Catholic Church's political context. His leadership in addressing the sexual abuse scandal through the "Charter for the Protection of Children and Young People" indicates a proactive and reformist approach to governance and pastoral care, prioritizing accountability and the protection of the vulnerable. Being appointed by Pope Francis, known for his relatively progressive stances on various issues, further aligns Gregory with a more liberal approach. His historic role as the first African-American president of the USCCB and the first African-American cardinal suggests an openness to diversity and inclusivity, aligning with more progressive values. Additionally, his early life experiences, including his decision to become a priest before converting to Catholicism, suggest a personal journey of faith that may resonate with contemporary issues of identity and belonging, further indicating a progressive inclination. However, without specific details on his stances on doctrinal issues, social reforms, or engagement with contemporary societal issues, the score is not at the extreme end of the spectrum.
