He was Bishop of Groningen-Leeuwarden from 1999 to 2007. Before his clerical career he worked as a medical doctor; as a priest he made medical ethics the focus of his academic studies.

Willem Jacobus Eijk was born on 22 June 1953 in Duivendrecht, North Holland, Netherlands and was raised by a Protestant father and a Catholic mother. Eijk studied medicine at the University of Amsterdam and received his degree in 1978. In 1978 and 1979 he worked as a doctor specializing in internal medicine. He studied for the priesthood at the seminary of Rolduc in Kerkrade. Beginning in 1979 he combined his theological formation with the study of medical ethics at Leiden University. He was ordained to priesthood in 1985 and was incardinated in the Diocese of Roermond. Then he went to work as a curate in the parish of St. Anthony of Padua in Venlo Blerick. In 1987 he earned a doctorate in medicine from the University of Leiden, with a dissertation about euthanasia. In 1990 he completed a PhD in philosophy at the Pontifical University of St. Thomas Aquinas (Angelicum) with a dissertation entitled The ethical problems of genetic engineering of human beings.[citation needed] Eijk also earned a licentiate in theology at the Pontifical Lateran University in Rome. At the same time he taught moral theology at the seminary of Rolduc. From 1996, Eijk was professor of moral theology in pontifical Faculty of Theology in Lugano, Switzerland.

He chose the motto Noli recusare laborem ("Do not reject the work"), taken from the last words of Martin of Tours.

Political Analysis: Cardinal Willem Jacobus "Wim" Eijk's biographical details suggest a strong leaning towards conservative/traditionalist positions within the Catholic Church's political spectrum. His academic and professional background, particularly his focus on medical ethics and the ethical problems of genetic engineering, indicates a deep engagement with issues where the Church traditionally holds conservative views, such as the sanctity of life and opposition to euthanasia. His doctoral dissertation on euthanasia, a topic that the Catholic Church opposes, further underscores his alignment with conservative doctrinal positions. Additionally, his decision to restrict the role of the laity in church services as Bishop of Groningen-Leeuwarden reflects a preference for traditional clerical roles over more progressive, inclusive approaches to lay participation in liturgical functions. His choice of episcopal motto, "Noli recusare laborem" ("Do not reject the work"), taken from the last words of Martin of Tours, suggests a commitment to duty and service, aligning with a traditionalist ethos. Furthermore, his membership in the International Theological Commission, an advisory body to the Holy See that deals with doctrinal issues, indicates his involvement in discussions at the heart of Church teaching and governance, likely reinforcing a conservative approach to theology and ecclesial practice. Given these factors, Eijk's overall political leaning within the Church context is assessed as significantly conservative/traditionalist.
