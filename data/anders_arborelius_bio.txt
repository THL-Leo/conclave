Lars Anders Cardinal Arborelius OCD (Swedish: [ˈânːdɛʂ arbʊˈrěːlɪɵs]; born 24 September 1949) is a senior-ranking Swedish Catholic prelate who has served as Bishop of Stockholm since 1998. Pope Francis made him a cardinal, the first ever from Scandinavia, in 2017. He is a member of the Discalced Carmelites and was considered a candidate in the 2025 papal conclave. Arborelius was born on 24 September 1949 in Sorengo, Switzerland, to Swedish Protestant parents, and grew up in Lund in Scania. He was raised as a Lutheran Protestant and always showed a lot of interest in the contemplative life, saying, "I always had this longing for a life of prayer and silent adoration." After a year-and-a-half-long process, he observed, "Truth has been given to me through the Catholic faith,” and he converted to Catholicism at the age of 20. At first, following his conversion, he desired to be a diocesan priest, but, after reading Saint Thérèse of Lisieux's autobiography (The Story of a Soul), he wanted to be a member of the Discalced Carmelites. In 1971, two years after he became Catholic, he entered the Carmelite order at the Norraby monastery located near the town of Tågarp in Southern Sweden. In 1977, Arborelius took his perpetual vows in Bruges, Belgium, where he then obtained his degree in philosophy and theology. He also studied modern languages at Lund University. After obtaining his doctoral degree at the Pontifical Theological Faculty Teresianum in Rome, he was ordained as a priest in Malmö on 8 September 1979. On 17 November 1998, Pope John Paul II appointed Arborelius Bishop of Stockholm, and he was consecrated on 29 December 1998 by Bishop Hubert Brandenburg. When he succeeded Brandenburg as the Bishop of Stockholm—the only Catholic diocese in Sweden, comprising the entire country—he became the first ethnic Swedish Catholic Bishop since the Protestant Reformation. Most Catholics in Sweden since the Reformation, particularly among the clergy, have been immigrants or of immigrant descent from all over Europe (but especially Eastern Europe) and from the Middle East, as well as Arabs and Armenians of various Catholic rites. Additionally, there are converts from various backgrounds, including some Protestant ministers, who have become part of the Catholic community in his diocese. Arborelius took part in The Indian Priest (2015), a documentary film about Indian missionary priest Raphael Curian.

Political Analysis: Cardinal Lars Anders Arborelius's background and actions suggest a moderate leaning towards progressive within the Catholic Church's context, warranting a score of 0.3. His conversion from Lutheranism to Catholicism, influenced by a deep contemplative and prayerful inclination, indicates an openness to spiritual exploration and change, which often aligns with more progressive views. His choice to join the Discalced Carmelites, inspired by Saint Thérèse of Lisieux, a saint known for her "little way" of spirituality that emphasizes simplicity and love over rigorous asceticism, further suggests a preference for a more personal, less dogmatic approach to faith.

Arborelius's academic pursuits in philosophy, theology, and modern languages, along with his doctoral studies in Rome, imply a broad intellectual foundation that could accommodate diverse perspectives, often a characteristic of more progressive individuals. His historical significance as the first ethnic Swedish Catholic Bishop since the Reformation, serving in a diocese with a significant number of immigrants and converts, suggests an openness and adaptability to multiculturalism and inclusivity, aligning with more progressive stances on social issues.

His participation in a documentary about an Indian missionary priest reflects an engagement with contemporary issues and a global perspective on the Church's mission, indicating a willingness to bridge cultural divides and highlight universal aspects of Catholic pastoral care.

However, there is no explicit mention of Arborelius challenging Church doctrine or tradition directly, nor any specific advocacy for reform in Church governance or doctrine, which prevents a classification towards the extreme end of the progressive spectrum. Therefore, his score reflects a moderate progressive leaning, characterized by a balanced approach to tradition and openness to contemporary issues and inclusivity within the Church.
