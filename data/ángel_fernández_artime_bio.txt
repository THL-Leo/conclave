Ángel Fernández Artime, S.D.B. (Chinese: 范達民, born 21 August 1960) is a Spanish Catholic prelate who has served as Pro-Prefect of the Dicastery for Institutes of Consecrated Life and Societies of Apostolic Life since 2025. He was Rector Major of the Salesians from 2014 to 2024, the first Spaniard to hold that office. He was previously provincial superior of the Salesian Province of Leon from 2000 to 2006 and of the Southern Argentina Province from 2009 to 2014. Pope Francis made Fernández a cardinal in 2023 and allowed him to continue as rector until 16 August 2024. He was the first cleric made a cardinal while heading a religious order and the first cardinal elector not already a bishop since Roberto Tucci in 2001.[a] Fernández's episcopal consecration was celebrated on 20 April 2024. Ángel Fernández Artime was born in Gozón-Luanco, Asturias, on 21 August 1960. His father was a fisherman and his mother sold his catch. In 1970 his family moved to Astudillo, Palencia, where he enrolled in boarding school. He then studied for three years in Cambados (Pontevedra) and then entered the Salesian school in León. He professed his first vows on 3 September 1978 and his final vows on 17 June 1984 in Santiago de Campostela. He was ordained a priest on 4 July 1987 in León. Fernández holds a bachelor's degree in pastoral theology, philosophy and pedagogy from the University of Valladolid. Following his ordination, he began his ministry teaching religion at the Santo Angel Salesian College of Avilés (Asturias)[citation needed] and was then director of the Salesian College of Ourense. As a member of the Salesian Province of León, Fernandez was a member of the Provincial Council and vice provincial. From 2000 to 2006 he was superior of that Province. He was selected to team with the organizers of the 26th General Chapter in Rome in 2008. In 2009 he was elected provincial for the Southern Argentina Province, headquartered in Buenos Aires. There Fernandez worked with Cardinal Jorge Mario Bergoglio, who later became Pope Francis.

Political Analysis: Ángel Fernández Artime's biography suggests a moderate to progressive leaning within the Catholic Church's political spectrum, meriting a score of 0.4. Several factors contribute to this assessment:

1. **Close Association with Pope Francis:** Fernández's work with Cardinal Jorge Mario Bergoglio (now Pope Francis) in Buenos Aires is significant. Pope Francis is known for his relatively progressive stance on various issues, including social justice, environmental concerns, and a more inclusive approach to pastoral care. Fernández's collaboration with him suggests an alignment with these more progressive views.

2. **Leadership in the Salesians:** As Rector Major of the Salesians, a position he held for a decade, Fernández would have been deeply involved in issues of education, social justice, and youth outreach, areas where the Salesians have historically taken progressive stances. The Salesians' focus on education and social work aligns with a more open and community-oriented approach to Church doctrine and governance.

3. **Pastoral Background:** His extensive pastoral work, including teaching religion and directing a Salesian college, indicates a hands-on approach to ministry. This practical involvement in education and pastoral care often requires a more adaptive and sometimes progressive approach to effectively address contemporary issues and the needs of the faithful.

4. **Theological Education:** Fernández holds a bachelor's degree in pastoral theology, philosophy, and pedagogy, suggesting a well-rounded theological education that includes pastoral theology, which often emphasizes a more compassionate and context-sensitive approach to doctrine and pastoral care.

5. **Position in the Church Hierarchy:** His appointment by Pope Francis as a cardinal and his role as Pro-Prefect of the Dicastery for Institutes of Consecrated Life and Societies of Apostolic Life place him in positions where he can influence the Church's direction towards a more engaged and possibly reform-oriented stance on various issues, including the life and governance of religious orders.

However, the absence of explicit statements or actions directly challenging core Church doctrines or pushing for radical reforms prevents a classification further towards the liberal/progressive end of the spectrum. His background and positions suggest a moderate progressive leaning that respects tradition while being open to adaptation and engagement with contemporary issues.
