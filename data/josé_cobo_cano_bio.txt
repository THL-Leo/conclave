José Cobo Cano (born 20 September 1965) is a Spanish Catholic prelate who served as Archbishop of Madrid since 2023. He previously served as auxiliary bishop of the archdiocese. Pope Francis made him a cardinal in 2023. Cobo became a priest in 1994 and was named an auxiliary bishop in 2017; after his ordination, he oversaw various social issue–related departments within the Spanish Episcopal Conference. Following a scandal about a case of sexual abuse by a teacher at an Opus Dei school, Cobo participated in a national meeting to address such cases within the Catholic Church. His appointment as archbishop in 2023 drew controversy due to his limited experience—the previous five archbishops of Madrid had all been bishops in their own dioceses—and his progressive views. During an interview, Cobo sparked controversy when he stated that he would not officiate same-sex marriages, comparing the act to celebrating the Eucharist with Coca-Cola. José Cobo was born on 20 September 1965 in the municipality of Sabiote, Andalusia, where he was baptized in the Parochial Church of San Pedro [es]. At 7 years old he went with his parents, Agustín and Pauli, to Madrid. He earned a licentiate degree in civil law from the Complutense University of Madrid in 1988. The same year, he entered the Madrid Conciliary Seminary [es] and San Damaso the same year, where he completed his ecclesiastical studies. He pursued moral science at the Comillas Pontifical University (1994–1996).

Role: Archbishop of Madrid

Order: CP

Political Analysis: José Cobo Cano's profile suggests a moderate to slightly progressive leaning within the Catholic Church's political spectrum. His engagement with social issues, as evidenced by his leadership roles in departments related to social issues within the Spanish Episcopal Conference, indicates a pastoral concern that aligns with more progressive views on the Church's role in society. His participation in a national meeting to address sexual abuse cases within the Church reflects a willingness to confront and address contemporary issues that have been points of contention and reform within the Church, aligning with a more progressive stance on transparency and accountability.

However, his controversial statement regarding not officiating same-sex marriages, while comparing it to celebrating the Eucharist with Coca-Cola, suggests a traditionalist stance on certain doctrinal matters, particularly those related to sacraments and marriage. This indicates a nuanced position that respects traditional Church teachings on sacraments while engaging in progressive pastoral care and social issues.

Cobo's appointment as Archbishop of Madrid, despite his limited experience and amidst controversy over his progressive views, further suggests that his overall approach and theological positions are seen as aligning more closely with the reformist agenda of Pope Francis, who appointed him. This appointment, especially given the context of his predecessors' profiles, indicates a shift towards a more progressive direction, albeit one that still navigates within the broader doctrinal frameworks of the Church.

Therefore, Cobo's profile suggests a moderate to slightly progressive leaning, balancing traditional doctrinal positions with a more open approach to pastoral care, governance, and engagement with contemporary social issues.
