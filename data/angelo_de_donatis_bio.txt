Political Analysis: Angelo De Donatis' biographical text suggests a moderate conservative leaning within the Catholic Church context. His educational background in philosophy and theology at prestigious pontifical universities, along with his Licentiate in Sacred Theology in moral theology, indicates a solid foundation in traditional Catholic doctrine. His ordination by Bishop Antonio Rosario Mennonna, a figure likely aligned with the Church's traditional views given the era, and his long service in roles that support the clergy and seminarians, such as a spiritual director at the Pontifical Roman Major Seminary and director of the clergy of the Vicariate of Rome, further suggest a commitment to maintaining and nurturing the Church's traditional clerical and theological foundations.

De Donatis' role as the archivist of the Secretary of the College of Cardinals and his involvement in the pastoral council and college of consultors of the Diocese of Rome point to a deep engagement with the Church's governance structures, which typically conserves its doctrine and traditions. However, the lack of explicit mention of controversial social issues, reforms, or direct engagement with contemporary issues in the provided text prevents a classification of De Donatis as strongly conservative. His career trajectory, marked by significant pastoral and administrative roles within the Church, suggests a preference for continuity over radical change, aligning him more closely with conservative elements within the Church but not to the extent of being very conservative or traditionalist. Therefore, a score of -0.2 is appropriate, indicating a moderate conservative leaning with openness to pastoral care and governance within the established frameworks of the Church.
