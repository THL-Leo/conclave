His educational background, with a licentiate in biblical theology from the Pontifical Gregorian University, indicates a solid foundation in Church doctrine and a potential openness to contemporary theological insights. His role as diocesan assistant of Catholic Action, a movement known for its commitment to social justice aligned with Catholic teachings, hints at a proactive stance on social issues and reform. Serving in various capacities, including parish priest and rector of a major seminary, suggests a balanced approach to pastoral care, valuing both tradition and the needs of contemporary parishioners. His appointment by Pope Francis, known for his relatively progressive stance on various issues, as a cardinal and positions within the Roman Curia, particularly as vicar general of the Diocese of Rome, indicate trust in his ability to navigate Church governance in a manner that respects tradition while engaging with contemporary challenges.
