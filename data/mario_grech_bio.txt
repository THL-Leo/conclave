Mario Grech (Maltese: [ˈmɐːrɪɔ ˈɡrɛk]; born 20 February 1957) is a Maltese Catholic prelate who has served as Secretary General of the Synod of Bishops since 2020. He was previously Bishop of Gozo from 2005 to 2019 and Pro-Secretary General of the Synod of Bishops from 2019 to 2020. Pope Francis raised him to the rank of cardinal on 28 November 2020. Mario Grech was born in Qala, Gozo, on 20 February 1957. His family moved to Ta' Kerċem when he was a young boy. He attended the Victoria high school and then studied philosophy and theology at the Gozo diocesan seminary. He was ordained a priest on 26 May 1984 by Bishop Nikol Joseph Cauchi. He then obtained a licenciate in civil law and canon law at the Pontifical Lateran University and a doctorate in canon law at the Pontifical University of Saint Thomas Aquinas. He then fulfilled pastoral assignments at the Cathedral of Gozo, in the National Shrine of Ta' Pinu, and the parish of Kerċem. His responsibilities for the Diocese of Gozo included service as Judicial Vicar of the diocese, a member of the Metropolitan Court of Malta, teacher of canon law at the seminary, and a member of the College of Consultors, of the Presbyteral Council and of other diocesan commissions. On 26 November 2005, Pope Benedict XVI named him Bishop of Gozo. He received his episcopal consecration on 22 January 2006 from his predecessor in Gozo, Bishop Nikol Joseph Cauchi. In 2011, he joined other Maltese bishops in advising Catholics to defeat a referendum that would allow the legislature to consider legalizing divorce. As president of the Episcopal Conference of Malta, he participated in the Synod of Bishops on the Family in 2014 and 2015. Speaking to the Synod in October 2014, Grech said that "the doctrine of the faith is capable of progressively acquiring a greater depth" and that addressing people in complex familial relations, or homosexuals or parents of homosexuals, "It is necessary to learn to speak that language which is known to contemporary human beings and who acknowledge it as a way of conveying the truth and the charity of the Gospel." With Archbishop Charles Scicluna of Malta, Grech co-authored the Maltese bishops' pastoral guidelines on Amoris Laetitia, released in January 2017, which stated that in certain cases a divorced Catholic who remarried might receive Communion after "honest discernment". The guidelines were republished in L'Osservatore Romano.[a]

Political Analysis: Cardinal Mario Grech's biography suggests a leaning towards the liberal/progressive end of the spectrum within the context of Catholic Church politics. His involvement in the Synod of Bishops on the Family and his statements regarding the evolution of doctrine to address contemporary human experiences indicate a willingness to engage with and adapt to modern societal changes, which is a hallmark of more progressive stances within the Church. Furthermore, his co-authorship of the Maltese bishops' pastoral guidelines following Amoris Laetitia, which opened the possibility for divorced and remarried Catholics to receive Communion after discernment, marks a significant departure from traditionalist positions that strictly adhere to previous doctrinal interpretations. This approach to pastoral care, emphasizing mercy and inclusivity, aligns with Pope Francis' more progressive reforms. Grech's educational background in both civil and canon law, combined with his pastoral experience, suggests a comprehensive understanding of the Church's teachings and governance, which he appears to balance with a forward-looking view on doctrine and pastoral ministry.
