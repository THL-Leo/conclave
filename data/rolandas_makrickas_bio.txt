Rolandas Makrickas (born 31 January 1972) is a Lithuanian Catholic prelate who has served as coadjutor archpriest of the Basilica of Santa Maria Maggiore since 2024. He worked in the diplomatic service of the Holy See from 2006 to 2021, when he was given responsibility for reorganizing the administration of the basilica. He was granted the personal title of archbishop in 2023 and made a cardinal in 2024. Rolandas Makrickas was born on 31 January 1972 in Biržai, Lithuania, the youngest of five children. Because Soviet authorities restricted religious practice and catechesis, his early religious education was private and tersely accomplished. The end of the Soviet era allowed him to gain a more extensive understanding of his faith and ways of experiencing beyond ritual. While young he flew gliders and briefly considered a career in aviation. He entered Kaunas Priest Seminary in 1990, the second year it operated, and beginning in 1991 lived at the St. Casimir Lithuanian College in Rome while studying philosophy and theology at the Pontifical Gregorian University. He was ordained a priest of the Diocese of Panevėžys on 30 July 1996. From 1996 to 2001 he was under-secretary of the Lithuanian Bishops' Conference and headed the National Committee of the Great Jubilee of 2000. He earned a doctorate in church history at the Gregorian in 2004. He studied at the Pontifical Ecclesiastical Academy from 2003 to 2006[citation needed] and joined the diplomatic service of the Holy See on 1 July 2006 and fulfilled assignments first in Bolivia, in Georgia where he witnessed the destruction of the Russo-Georgian War, and in Sweden where the nunciature was responsible for several northern countries. He served in the United States from 2013 to 2017, which included a papal visit. For two years, he was chargé d'affaires in Gabon and counselor in Congo, where he joined in the Church's delivery of social services and managed a construction project. On 10 August 2019, he joined the Section for General Affairs of the Secretariat of State in Rome as head of administration, the first non-Italian to hold that position. In that role he participated in the reorganization of the Vatican's financial and administrative functions.

Political Analysis: Cardinal Rolandas Makrickas's biography suggests a moderate leaning with a slight tilt towards progressivism within the Catholic Church's political spectrum. His background in the diplomatic service of the Holy See, especially his roles in diverse cultural and geopolitical contexts (e.g., Bolivia, Georgia, Sweden, the United States, Gabon, and Congo), indicates a broad understanding of the global Church and an openness to engaging with contemporary issues and diverse cultures. His involvement in the Church's delivery of social services in Gabon and Congo, and his leadership in managing a construction project, show a practical approach to pastoral care and social justice, aligning with a more progressive stance on social issues and reform.

Furthermore, his role in the reorganization of the Vatican's financial and administrative functions, especially as the first non-Italian to hold the position of head of administration in the Section for General Affairs of the Secretariat of State, suggests a willingness to reform and modernize Church governance. This willingness to embrace change and tackle contemporary issues within the Church's administration points to a moderate progressive inclination.

However, there is no explicit mention of his stance on specific doctrinal issues, which prevents a full assessment towards a more definitive progressive score. His education in philosophy and theology at the Pontifical Gregorian University and his doctorate in church history suggest a deep understanding and respect for Church tradition and doctrine, which might temper his approach to reform and innovation. Thus, his overall political leaning within the Church context is assessed as moderately progressive, acknowledging the need for engagement with contemporary issues and reform while likely maintaining a respect for tradition.
