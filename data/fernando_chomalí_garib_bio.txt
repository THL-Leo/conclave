Political Analysis: Cardinal Fernando Natalio Chomali Garib's biographical details suggest a moderate conservative leaning within the Catholic Church's political spectrum. His educational background in moral theology and bioethics, particularly from institutions like the Pontifical Alphonsian Academy and the John Paul II Pontifical Theological Institute for Marriage and Family Sciences, indicates a strong foundation in traditional Catholic moral teachings. These institutions are known for their commitment to upholding the Church's teachings on moral issues, which often aligns with conservative positions within the Church.

His work in bioethics and his long-standing membership in the Pontifical Academy for Life, including a leadership role in its steering committee, further underscore his engagement with issues that are central to conservative elements in the Church, such as the sanctity of life and opposition to abortion. The Pontifical Academy for Life is an institution that advises the Church on life issues, often taking stances that are considered conservative, especially on matters like abortion, euthanasia, and bioethical research.

However, his pastoral roles, including serving as a parish vicar and parish priest, suggest a commitment to pastoral care and possibly a more nuanced approach to applying doctrine to the complexities of individuals' lives. This could indicate a slightly more moderate stance compared to a purely doctrinal conservative approach.

His academic and pastoral work does not explicitly indicate his stance on social issues, Church governance, or engagement with contemporary issues outside the realm of bioethics. Without explicit evidence of progressive views on these matters, it is reasonable to infer a moderate conservative leaning, hence the score of -0.3. This reflects a position within the Church that values tradition and doctrine, while potentially being open to pastoral sensitivity and care in the application of these principles.
