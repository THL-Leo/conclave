Stephen Ameyu Martin Mulla (born 10 January 1964) is a South Sudanese Catholic prelate who has served as Archbishop of Juba since 2020, after serving less than a year as Bishop of Torit. Pope Francis made him a cardinal on 30 September 2023. Stephen Ameyu Martin Mulla was born in Ido in the Diocese of Torit in the Equatoria region of Sudan, now in South Sudan, on 10 January 1964. He attended the minor seminary in Torit from 1978 to 1981 and that in Wau from 1981 to 1983. He then studied briefly at the Saint Paul National Major Seminary, followed by philosophy at the seminary of Bussere (Wau) from 1984 to 1987 and theology in Munuki (Juba) from 1988 to 1991. He was ordained a priest of the Diocese of Torit on 21 April 1991 for the diocese of Torit. He then filled a variety of pastoral assignments for three years. From 1993 to 1997 he studied at the Pontifical Urban University, earning a doctorate in dogmatic theology, with a thesis titled "Verso il dialogo religioso e la riconciliazione in Sudan" ("Towards religious dialogue and reconciliation in Sudan") and from then until 2019 was a lecturer and dean of the Saint Paul National Major Seminary in Juba. He taught evening classes at the Comboni College for Adults and Teachers from 1998 to 2000 and was a lecturer and consultant for the local Sudanese organization for non-violence and democracy (SONAD) from 1999 to 2008. He founded a local humanitarian NGO, the Horiok Community Association and Development (HODA) in 2005 and worked there as a consultant and counsellor for five years. He worked in a similar capacity for women's rights organizations from 2013 to 2016, and then from 2016 to 2019 as assistant vice chancellor for Administration and Finance of the Catholic University of South Sudan and deputy director of the Institute of Applied Research and Community Outreach there. On 3 January 2019, Pope Francis appointed him bishop of Torit, a see which had been without a bishop for five years. He received his episcopal consecration on 3 March of that year from Paulino Lukudu Loro, Archbishop of Juba. On 12 December 2019, Pope Francis promoted him to archbishop of Juba and he was both installed there on 22 March 2020 and named apostolic administrator of Torit the same day. His appointment as archbishop met with some opposition, possibly tied to ethnic divisions, that included charges of improper influence and unsuitability, which Pope Francis reviewed and nevertheless confirmed the appointment on 6 March. Those who opposed Ameyu's appointment said that they had no objection based on tribal affiliation, though they were Bari and Ameyu is Otuho.

Political Analysis: Cardinal Stephen Ameyu Martin Mulla's biography suggests a leaning towards the more liberal/progressive end of the spectrum within the context of Catholic Church politics, meriting a score of 0.7. This assessment is based on several key aspects of his background and work:

1. **Engagement with Social Issues and Reform**: Ameyu's active involvement with women's rights organizations and the founding of a local humanitarian NGO (HODA) indicate a strong commitment to social justice issues, aligning with more progressive stances within the Church.

2. **Focus on Dialogue and Reconciliation**: His doctoral thesis on religious dialogue and reconciliation in Sudan, along with his work as a consultant for a non-violence and democracy organization, reflects an openness to dialogue and peacebuilding. This approach is consistent with a more progressive outlook that values engagement over confrontation.

3. **Pastoral Care and Governance**: His varied pastoral assignments and roles in educational and research institutions suggest a holistic approach to pastoral care, emphasizing both education and community engagement. This multifaceted approach, especially in a conflict-ridden context like South Sudan, points to a progressive understanding of the Church's role in society.

4. **Theological Positions**: Earning a doctorate in dogmatic theology with a focus on dialogue and reconciliation, and his subsequent academic roles, suggest a theological openness to addressing contemporary issues through the lens of faith and reason. This intellectual openness is often associated with more progressive theological positions.

5. **Response to Opposition**: The opposition to his appointment as Archbishop of Juba, despite being confirmed by Pope Francis, indicates that Ameyu's leadership style or perspectives might challenge existing conservative or traditionalist structures within the local Church context. His confirmation by Pope Francis, known for his own more progressive stances on various issues, further suggests alignment with a reformist agenda.

While the available information does not detail specific theological positions on controversial issues (e.g., LGBTQ+ rights, ordination of women), the overall evidence of his work and focus areas strongly suggests a leaning towards progressive approaches within the Church's engagement with contemporary societal challenges.
