Philippe Xavier Christian Ignace Marie Barbarin (born 17 October 1950) is a French Catholic prelate who served as Archbishop of Lyon from 2002 to 2020. He was made a cardinal in 2003. He was convicted in 2019 of failing to report alleged sex abuse by a priest and was given a suspended six-month prison sentence. The same year, Barbarin turned the archdiocese over to an administrator while he appealed his case. His conviction was overturned in 2020 but Pope Francis accepted his resignation just over a month later. Philippe Barbarin was born in 1950 in Rabat, French Morocco, then a French protectorate, into a large family with six sisters, two of whom are nuns, and four brothers. Barbarin studied at the public Lycée Marcellin Berthelot in Saint-Maur and then in Paris at the Catholic Collège des Francs-Bourgeois, where he completed his baccalaureate. He studied philosophy at the Major Seminary of Paris, the Institute for Comparative Philosophy, and the Sorbonne, interrupted for a time by military service. In 1973 he entered the Institut Catholique de Paris, where he earned a theology bachelor. He was ordained on 17 December 1977 by Bishop Robert de Provenchères of Créteil. Barbarin held a variety of pastoral assignments in France until 1994, when he taught theology in the Archdiocese of Fianarantsoa, Madagascar. On 1 October 1998, he was appointed Bishop of Moulins. He received his episcopal consecration on the following 22 November from the Jesuit Archbishop Philibert Randriambololona of Fianarantsoa, with Bishops André Quélen and Daniel Labille serving as co-consecrators. Barbarin was named Archbishop of Lyon on 16 July 2002. He was created Cardinal-Priest of SS. Trinità al Monte Pincio by Pope John Paul II in the consistory of 21 October 2003. On 24 November 2003 he was made a member of the Congregation for Divine Worship and the Discipline of the Sacraments and the Congregation for Institutes of Consecrated Life and Societies of Apostolic Life. He was one of the cardinal electors who participated in the 2005 papal conclave that elected Pope Benedict XVI, the 2013 conclave that elected Pope Francis, and the 2025 conclave that elected Pope Leo XIV.

Political Analysis: Cardinal Philippe Barbarin's biographical details suggest a moderate conservative leaning within the Catholic Church's political spectrum. His long tenure in various pastoral and theological roles, including his service as Archbishop of Lyon and his creation as Cardinal by Pope John Paul II, a pope known for his conservative stance on doctrine and tradition, positions him more towards the conservative end of the spectrum. His membership in the Congregation for Divine Worship and the Discipline of the Sacraments, as well as the Congregation for Institutes of Consecrated Life and Societies of Apostolic Life, both Vatican bodies that oversee aspects of Church life closely tied to tradition and orthodoxy, further supports a conservative orientation.

However, the absence of specific stances on controversial issues such as LGBT rights, women's ordination, or the celibacy of priests in the provided text prevents a classification of Barbarin as very conservative. The text does not detail his views on social issues, reform, or engagement with contemporary issues, which are critical factors in determining a more precise political leaning within the Church context. Additionally, his conviction (later overturned) for failing to report alleged sex abuse might suggest a less traditional approach to governance and transparency, potentially indicating a slight openness to reform or at least a complex relationship with traditional clerical authority structures. Therefore, a score of -0.3 is assigned, reflecting a moderate conservative leaning with acknowledgment of the limitations in the available information for a comprehensive analysis.
