Stephen Chow Sau-yan, S.J. (Chinese: 周守仁, born 7 August 1959) is a Hong Kong prelate of the Catholic Church who has served as Bishop of Hong Kong since 2021. He was the provincial superior of the Chinese Province of the Society of Jesus from 2018 to 2021. Chow was promoted to cardinal by Pope Francis on 30 September 2023. Chow was born in British Hong Kong on 7 August 1959. He studied psychology and philosophy at the University of Minnesota, obtaining a bachelor's degree and a master's degree in Educational Psychology. He joined the Society of Jesus in 1984, completing his noviceship in 1986. He studied at the Milltown Institute of Theology and Philosophy in Dublin, earning a licenciate in philosophy in 1988. He then returned to Hong Kong and taught at Wah Yan College, Kowloon for two years. Starting in 1990, he studied theology at the Holy Spirit Seminary in Hong Kong. On 16 July 1994, Chow was ordained a priest in the Cathedral of the Immaculate Conception by John Baptist Wu, Bishop of Hong Kong. He undertook postgraduate studies at Loyola University Chicago, receiving a master's degree in organizational development in 1995. Chow's first pastoral assignment was at Wah Yan Kowloon and Hong Kong, where he was chaplain, teacher, and school manager from 1996 to 2000. He began doctoral studies at Harvard University in 2000 and received his Doctor of Education degree six years later. His thesis was titled "Understanding Moral Culture in Hong Kong Secondary Schools: Relationships among Moral Norm, Moral Culture, Academic Achievement Motivation, and Empathy". He made his final vows on 17 April 2007. Until 2021, Chow served as supervisor of both Wah Yan colleges in Kowloon and Hong Kong Island. He was an honorary assistant professor at the University of Hong Kong from 2007 to 2014, as well as a part-time professor of psychology at Holy Spirit Seminary. He participated at the Jesuits' 36th General Congregation in October 2016. Chow succeeded John Lee Hua as provincial superior of the Chinese Province of the Society of Jesus on 1 January 2018. Chow was appointed Bishop of Hong Kong on 17 May 2021. The see had been vacant since 3 January 2019, when Michael Yeung died after less than two years in office. His appointment was described as a surprise by the Jesuit magazine America given that he had not been mentioned as one of the likely candidates for the post. The Union of Catholic Asian News had mentioned in January 2019 that two of the candidates were Jesuits, without naming them. Chow later revealed that he initially declined the bishop's title in December 2020 because he thought the post should go to a member of the secular clergy. He relented after receiving a handwritten letter from Pope Francis. He was consecrated on 4 December 2021.

Political Analysis: Cardinal Stephen Chow Sau-yan's background and actions suggest a moderate leaning towards the progressive side within the Catholic Church's political spectrum, meriting a score of 0.3. His education in psychology and philosophy, along with a Doctor of Education from Harvard University, indicates an openness to contemporary academic disciplines and methodologies, which often correlate with a more progressive outlook. His thesis on "Understanding Moral Culture in Hong Kong Secondary Schools" suggests an interest in the practical application of moral principles in education, potentially indicating a nuanced approach to moral and social issues. 

Chow's membership in the Society of Jesus (Jesuits) is also significant, as the Jesuits are known for their emphasis on social justice, education, and engagement with the world, traits generally associated with more progressive elements within the Church. His leadership roles within the Jesuit order, including serving as the provincial superior of the Chinese Province, and his participation in the Jesuits' 36th General Congregation, further indicate his active involvement in forward-thinking religious communities.

His initial reluctance to accept the bishopric, deferring to a member of the secular clergy, and his eventual acceptance after a personal appeal from Pope Francis, suggests a humility and openness to discernment, which are not strictly progressive traits but indicate a pastoral sensitivity and a willingness to engage in dialogue, often valued by more progressive Church leaders.

However, there is a lack of specific information on his stances on hot-button doctrinal issues, direct engagement with contemporary social issues, or explicit calls for reform within the Church, which prevents a classification of him as strongly progressive. Thus, while leaning towards progressivism, especially in the context of education and pastoral care, the evidence does not support a characterization of Chow as very liberal within the Church's political spectrum.
