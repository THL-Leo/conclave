François-Xavier Bustillo OFM Conv. (born 23 November 1968) is a Spanish-born French Catholic prelate who has served as Bishop of Ajaccio since 2021. He is a member of the Conventual Franciscans and has spent his priesthood in France. Pope Francis made him a cardinal on 30 September 2023. He names himself François Bustillo on the website of his diocese[a] and is often referred to by that name on Church websites and in other media. Named Francisco-Javier Bustillo Rípodas at his birth on 23 November 1968 in Pamplona in Navarre, Spain, he was the eldest of four children. His father was a career soldier. He had several relatives who had religious vocations. When barely ten years old he chose to attend the seminary in Baztan, Navarre, rather than the school in his hometown. At age 17 he joined the Order of Conventual Franciscans in Padua, Italy, where he completed his work in philosophy and theology at the Istituto Teologico Sant'Antonio Dottore. He earned a licentiate in theology at the Catholic University of Toulouse in 1997. He professed his vows as a Franciscan on 20 September 1992 and was ordained a priest on 10 September 1994. He later said he took his vows and was ordained in Spain for his family's sake: "Otherwise they would have killed me." In 1994 he was one of the Franciscans who reestablished the Convent of Saint Bonaventure in Narbonne, France, which was founded in 1260 and abandoned in 1934. Their mission was to evangelize a region that had been de-Christianized. From 2006 to 2018 he was Provincial Custos of the Conventual Franciscans for France and Belgium, and from 2005 to 2018 carried out his ministry in the diocese of Carcassonne-Narbonne, serving as a parish priest, as a member of the diocesan council from 2007 to 2018, as episcopal vicar for a region of the diocese, and as diocesan delegate for new spirituality movements and for interreligious dialogue from 2012 to 2018. From 2018 to 2021 he was appointed guardian of the convent of Saint-Maximilien-Kolbe in Lourdes, France. In October 2019, he was named episcopal delegate for the protection of minors and the vulnerable for the Diocese of Tarbes-et-Lourdes. He has said he enjoyed assignments that kept him on the move and preferred the challenge presented by France rather than working in Italy or Spain which would have been "too easy". He became a naturalized French citizen on 31 October 2006.

Political Analysis: François-Xavier Bustillo's biography suggests a moderate to progressive leaning within the Catholic Church context, meriting a score of 0.6. His membership in the Conventual Franciscans, an order known for its commitment to poverty, evangelization, and social justice, aligns with more progressive elements of the Church. His focus on evangelizing de-Christianized regions and his involvement in new spirituality movements and interreligious dialogue indicate an openness to contemporary issues and a willingness to engage with the modern world, which are traits more commonly associated with progressive clergy. Additionally, his appointment as episcopal delegate for the protection of minors and the vulnerable reflects a proactive stance on one of the most pressing issues facing the Church today, suggesting a pastoral approach that prioritizes care and protection over traditionalist concerns. His naturalization as a French citizen and preference for challenging assignments over "easier" options in Italy or Spain further underscore his adaptability and openness to change. However, the lack of explicit statements on doctrinal matters or specific social issues prevents a full 1.0 score, as it remains unclear how far his progressive tendencies extend into doctrinal reform or liberal theological positions.
