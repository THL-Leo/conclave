Dominique Joseph Mathieu, O.F.M. Conv. (born 13 June 1963) is a Belgian Catholic prelate who has served as Archbishop of Tehran–Isfahan since 2021. He is a member of the Order of Friars Minor Conventual. He was made a cardinal on 7 December 2024 by Pope Francis. Dominique Mathieu was born in Arlon in Belgian Luxembourg, the southernmost province of Belgium, on 13 June 1963. Growing up he lived in Damme, though by his own account he grew up in Bruges, a few miles away, where he studied with the Xaverian Brothers. Inspired by the figure of Maximilian Kolbe, he developed a relationship with the Order of Friars Minor Conventual in Louvain. He joined that order at 21 and professed his solemn vows on 20 September 1987. He was ordained a deacon on 1 April 1989 and a priest on 24 September 1989. Within his Franciscan order he has held various positions: vocational promoter, secretary, vicar and provincial minister of the Belgian province of the Friars Minor Conventual, serving as delegate general when the provinces of Belgium and France merged; rector of the national shrine of Saint Anthony of Padua in Brussels and director of its Confraternity. He was also president of two non-profit organizations that support the Friars Minor Conventual in Belgium, and had responsibilities with the Catholic School of Landen. He has served as president of the Central Europe Federation of the Friars Minor Conventual (Austria, Croatia, Denmark, Germany, Holland, Slovenia, Sweden, Switzerland) and was a member of the Franciscans' International Commission for the Economy. He moved to Lebanon in 2013 and was incardinated in the Provincial Custody of the East and of the Holy Land. He served that province as custodial secretary, formator, master of novices and rector of postulants and candidates. From 2019 to 2021 he was definitor general and general assistant for the Central Europe Federation of the Friars Minor Conventual.

Political Analysis: Dominique Joseph Mathieu's biography suggests a moderate to slightly progressive leaning within the Catholic Church's political spectrum. His membership and leadership roles within the Order of Friars Minor Conventual, an order known for its commitment to poverty, fraternity, and ministry to the marginalized, align with a more progressive approach to pastoral care and social justice, indicative of a positive score. His inspiration by Maximilian Kolbe, a saint known for his martyrdom and dedication to others, further suggests a focus on self-sacrifice and social engagement, aligning with more progressive values. His extensive involvement in non-profit organizations and educational initiatives indicates a proactive stance on social issues and reform, as well as an engagement with contemporary issues beyond traditional ecclesiastical boundaries. However, there is no explicit mention of his stance on hot-button doctrinal issues (e.g., LGBT rights, women's ordination, celibacy for priests), which might have warranted a higher score. His leadership within a traditional order and the lack of explicit mention of challenging Church doctrine suggest a moderate rather than a radical progressive position. Thus, a score of 0.4 reflects a leaning towards progressive views, particularly in terms of social justice and pastoral care, while still operating within the established frameworks of the Church.
