Roberto Repole (born 29 January 1967) is an Italian Catholic prelate who has served as Archbishop of Turin and Bishop of Susa since 2022. He taught theology at the university level from 1996 to 2022 and headed the Italian Theological Association from 2011 to 2016. Pope Francis made Repole a cardinal on 7 December 2024. Roberto Repole was born in the Givoletto district of Turin on 29 January 1967. His father was a municipal councilor in Druento. Both his parents were originally from Rapone in southern Italy. He completed his studies at the Liceo Valsalice [it] in Turin in 1986 and then obtained his bachelor's degree in theology from the Faculty of Turin in 1992. He earned his licentiate (1998) and doctorate (2001) in theology at the Pontifical Gregorian University. He was ordained a priest on 13 June 1992 by Cardinal Giovanni Saldarini. He then served as parish vicar from 1992 to 1996, lecturer in systematic theology at the Theological Faculty of Turin and the Higher Institute of Religious Sciences in Turin from 1996 to 2022, canon of the Royal Church of Saint Lawrence from 2010 to 2022, president of the Italian Theological Association from 2011 to 2016, and rector of the Turin section of the Theological Faculty of Northern Italy from 2016 to 2022. He was also a member of the administrative board of the Holy See Agency for the Evaluation and Promotion of Quality in Ecclesiastical Universities and Faculties (AVEPRO) from 2016 to 2022. His roles on behalf of the archdiocese of Turin have included: coordinator of university pastoral care and a member for five years of the Diocesan Ecumenical Commission. Until 2022 he worked with the Santa Maria della Stella parish in Druento, was the diocesan ecclesiastical assistant of the Ecclesial Movement for Cultural Commitment (MEIC), and a member of the priests council. Repole has been identified by some commentators as a "boariniano," that is, the member of a group of theologically and politically liberal clerics influenced by Sergio Boarino, who served as the rector of the Turin seminary during the 1980s and 1990s.

Political Analysis: Cardinal Roberto Repole's background and activities suggest a leaning towards the liberal/progressive end of the spectrum within the context of Catholic Church politics. His long tenure as a theology professor and his leadership in the Italian Theological Association, coupled with his involvement in university pastoral care and the Diocesan Ecumenical Commission, indicate a strong commitment to education, dialogue, and the integration of contemporary issues into the life of the Church. His identification as a "boariniano" further solidifies this assessment, as it aligns him with a group known for its liberal theological and political stances, influenced by Sergio Boarino's progressive approach during his time as rector of the Turin seminary. Additionally, his active role in the Ecclesial Movement for Cultural Commitment (MEIC) and his engagement with the Santa Maria della Stella parish in Druento, where he was involved in pastoral care, suggest a forward-thinking approach to pastoral ministry and social issues. His appointment by Pope Francis, known for his own progressive views, as a cardinal further supports the assessment of Repole's liberal leaning within the Church.
