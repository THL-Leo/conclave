Giuseppe Betori (born 25 February 1947) is an Italian prelate of the Catholic Church who was Archbishop of Florence from 2008 to 2024. He became a bishop in 2001 when he was appointed secretary general of the Italian Episcopal Conference (CEI), a post he held until 2008. He was elevated to the rank of cardinal in 2012. Giuseppe Betori was born in Foligno, Italy, on 25 February 1947. He was ordained a priest on 26 September 1970. He earned a licentiate in theology at the Pontifical Gregorian University and a doctorate in Sacred Scripture at the Pontifical Biblical Institute. While serving in local parishes in Foligno he was Professor of Sacred Scripture and Dean of the Theological Institute of Assisi; diocesan assistant of Catholic Action; director of the Regional Pastoral Centre; assistant at the Youth Pastoral Center of the S. Carlo Institute in Foligno; coordinator of the Secretariat of the Ecclesiastical Conference held in Palermo in 1995; vice-president of the Italian Committee for the XV World Youth Day; and director of the Catechistic Office of the CEI. He also served as undersecretary of Italian Episcopal Conference from 1996 to 2001.[citation needed] On 5 April 2001, Pope John Paul II named Betori Secretary General of the Italian Episcopal Conference and Titular Bishop of Falerone. He received his episcopal consecration on 6 May 2001. In 2005, Betori supported a ban on the ordination of homosexuals. He said this could not be called "discrimination" because a priestly vocation is a "gift" rather than a "right". His appointment as secretary general of the CEI was confirmed for another five-year term on 6 April 2006.

Political Analysis: Giuseppe Betori's biography suggests a leaning towards the conservative/traditionalist side of the spectrum within the Catholic Church's political context. His support for the ban on the ordination of homosexuals in 2005, arguing that it cannot be considered "discrimination" because the priesthood is a "gift" rather than a "right," clearly aligns with conservative views on Church doctrine and tradition, especially regarding clerical celibacy and the Church's teachings on sexuality. Furthermore, his roles in various capacities, such as the director of the Catechistic Office of the Italian Episcopal Conference (CEI) and his involvement in the World Youth Day, indicate a commitment to traditional catechesis and evangelization methods. His academic background in theology and Sacred Scripture, combined with his pastoral roles in local parishes and regional pastoral centers, suggests a deep respect for Church doctrine and a preference for maintaining traditional interpretations and applications of these teachings. While the text does not provide explicit details on his views on social issues, reform, or engagement with contemporary issues outside of the ordination topic, his positions within the Church hierarchy and his actions as described align him more closely with conservative elements within the Catholic Church.
