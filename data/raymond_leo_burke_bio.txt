Raymond Leo Burke (born June 30, 1948) is an American Catholic prelate of the Catholic Church. He served as patron of the Sovereign Military Order of Malta from 2014 to 2023. He previously served as Archbishop of St. Louis from 2004 to 2008 and Bishop of La Crosse from 1995 to 2004. From 2008 to 2014, he was the prefect of the Supreme Tribunal of the Apostolic Signatura. He was made a cardinal in 2010. A canon lawyer, Burke is perceived as a voice of traditionalism among prelates of the Catholic Church. He established a reputation as a conservative leader while serving in La Crosse and St. Louis. Burke is a major proponent of the Tridentine Mass, having frequently offered it and conferred ordinations on traditionalist priests. He has criticized what he sees as deficiencies in the post-1969 Mass of Paul VI. He is frequently seen as a de facto leader of the Church's conservative wing by some mainstream media outlets. Burke publicly clashed with Pope Francis, vigorously opposing attempts by other bishops to relax church attitudes towards LGBTQ people and Catholics who have divorced and remarried outside the Church. Burke opposes euthanasia, and has opined that Catholic politicians who support legalized abortion, including former President Joe Biden, should not receive the Eucharist. While Burke denied allegations of disloyalty to Pope Francis, a number of Burke's statements were interpreted as criticisms, once mentioning the possible need to "formally correct" the pope in relation to Amoris laetitia. This has led to a backlash from some Catholics towards Burke. In September 2015, the Vatican announced that Burke had been reappointed to the Congregation for the Causes of Saints, from which he had been removed in December 2013, but not to his more influential positions on the Congregation for Bishops and the Apostolic Signatura. In 2016, he was not reappointed as a member of the Congregation for Divine Worship. In February 2017, Burke was again sidelined when Pope Francis appointed Archbishop Giovanni Angelo Becciu as his special delegate to the Sovereign Military Order of Malta, with exclusive responsibility for the duties which would normally be exercised by Burke as its patron. Albrecht von Boeselager, the order's grand chancellor, announced that this meant Burke was "de facto suspended" from the patronage. Pope Francis reappointed him as a rank-and-file member of the Apostolic Signatura in September 2017. In November 2023, Pope Francis reportedly evicted Burke from his subsidized Vatican apartment and removed his salary as a retired cardinal. Burke was born on June 30, 1948, in Richland Center, Wisconsin, the youngest of the six children of Thomas F. and Marie B. Burke. He is of Irish heritage with ancestors from counties Cork and Tipperary. Burke attended St. Mary's Parish School in Richland Center from 1954 to 1959. The family later moved to Stratford, Wisconsin. Having decided to become a priest, Burke entered Holy Cross Seminary in 1962 in La Crosse, Wisconsin.

Political Analysis: Cardinal Raymond Leo Burke's biographical text clearly positions him at the very conservative or traditionalist end of the spectrum within the Catholic Church's political and theological landscape, meriting a score of -1.0. Several key points underscore this assessment:

1. **Stance on Church Doctrine and Tradition:** Burke is described as a "voice of traditionalism" and a "conservative leader," particularly noted for his support of the Tridentine Mass and criticism of the post-1969 Mass of Paul VI. His advocacy for traditional liturgy and ordination practices aligns with conservative views on church doctrine and tradition.

2. **Views on Social Issues and Reform:** Burke's opposition to attempts to relax church attitudes towards LGBTQ individuals and Catholics who have divorced and remarried outside the Church reflects a conservative stance on social issues. Additionally, his opposition to euthanasia and his belief that Catholic politicians who support legalized abortion should not receive the Eucharist further indicate conservative positions on moral and social matters.

3. **Approach to Pastoral Care:** His public clashes with Pope Francis over pastoral approaches, especially regarding Amoris Laetitia, suggest a preference for a more doctrinally rigid form of pastoral care, aligning with conservative pastoral practices.

4. **Position on Church Governance:** Burke's criticisms of Pope Francis, including the mention of a possible need to "formally correct" the pope, indicate a conservative viewpoint on church governance, favoring traditionalist interpretations over more progressive leadership styles.

5. **Engagement with Contemporary Issues:** His engagements and public statements on contemporary issues, such as the reception of the Eucharist by politicians who support abortion, demonstrate a conservative approach to engaging with modern societal challenges.

6. **Theological Positions:** Burke's theological positions, as evidenced by his support for the Tridentine Mass and traditional ordination practices, further cement his standing as a conservative or traditionalist within the Church.

Overall, Cardinal Burke's actions, public statements, and theological stances firmly place him on the conservative or traditionalist end of the spectrum within the context of Catholic Church politics and theology.
