Political Analysis: Cardinal Leonardo Ulrich Steiner's biography suggests a leaning towards the liberal/progressive end of the spectrum within the context of Catholic Church politics, though not at the extreme end. His membership in the Order of Friars Minor (Franciscans) and his educational background, including a doctorate in philosophy, indicate an openness to intellectual and theological exploration, which is often associated with more progressive stances within the Church. His connection to Cardinal Arns, known for progressive views, further suggests a leaning towards reformist positions. His role as a seminary formator and novice master, along with his academic contributions, point to an emphasis on pastoral care and education, aligning with a more open, engaging approach to Church doctrine and governance. Additionally, being the first cardinal from the Amazon region and chosen by Pope Francis, who has shown a tendency to appoint more pastorally minded and socially conscious cardinals, suggests a predisposition towards engagement with contemporary issues, including environmental concerns and social justice, which are typically more aligned with progressive stances within the Church. However, the lack of specific information on his views on social issues, Church doctrine, and tradition prevents a full score towards the liberal extreme.
