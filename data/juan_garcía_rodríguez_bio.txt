Juan de la Caridad García Rodríguez (born 11 July 1948) is a Cuban prelate of the Catholic Church who has served as Archbishop of Havana since 26 April 2016. He previously served as an Auxiliary Bishop of Camagüey from 1997 to 2002 and then as archbishop of that diocese from 2002 to 2016. He is a past president of the Cuban Conference of Catholic Bishops. Pope Francis raised him to the rank of cardinal on 5 October 2019. He was born in Camagüey on 11 July 1948. He was a member of the first group of Cuban priests to be educated entirely in Cuba. He studied at Saint Basil the Great Seminary in El Cobre, Santiago de Cuba, and then at Saints Charles and Ambrose Seminary (now the Father Felix Varela Cultural Center) in Havana. He was ordained a priest on 25 January 1972. In the years after his ordination he worked in parishes that are now part of the Ciego de Ávila Diocese. In March 1997 he was named auxiliary bishop of Camagüey and was consecrated bishop in Camagüey's Our Lady of Mercy Church on 7 June 1997 by Adolfo Rodríguez Herrera, the bishop of Camagüey. He chose as his episcopal motto "Go and announce the Gospel". Camagüey became an archdiocese in late 1998 and he was named to succeed Herrera as archbishop in February 2002. He developed evangelization programs in which grandparents, who still remembered their education in Catholicism as children, taught the principles of Catholicism to their grandchildren. He also, with government permission, established prison ministries. García Rodríguez was the president of the First National Missions Assembly in Havana in 2006. He was elected president of the Cuban Conference of Catholic Bishops in 2006 and served until 2010. He represented Cuba at the fifth general assembly of Latin American and Caribbean bishops in Aparecida, Brazil, in 2007, which ended with the promulgation of the Declaration of Aparecida drafted by Cardinal Bergoglio of Buenos Aires (later Pope Francis). The Vatican named him a member of the Pontifical Council for Justice and Peace in February 2007. He participated in the 2014 sessions of the Synod on the Family.

Political Analysis: Juan de la Caridad García Rodríguez's biography reflects a moderate to progressive leaning within the Catholic Church's political spectrum, warranting a score of 0.4. His involvement in the development of evangelization programs that leverage familial relationships for religious education indicates a creative and adaptive approach to pastoral care, aligning with more progressive methods of engaging with the faithful. His establishment of prison ministries, with government permission, showcases a commitment to social justice and outreach to marginalized communities, a stance often associated with more progressive elements within the Church. Additionally, his participation in the 2014 Synod on the Family and his role in the fifth general assembly of Latin American and Caribbean bishops, particularly in connection with the Declaration of Aparecida, which was significantly influenced by Cardinal Bergoglio (later Pope Francis), suggests an openness to contemporary issues and a pastoral approach that is in line with Pope Francis's more inclusive and reform-oriented direction. His leadership roles, including his presidency of the Cuban Conference of Catholic Bishops, indicate a respect for Church governance but do not explicitly suggest a conservative or traditionalist stance on doctrine. Therefore, his theological positions and engagement with contemporary issues, combined with his innovative approaches to evangelization and pastoral care, position him closer to the progressive end of the spectrum, albeit not at the extreme, reflecting a balanced, yet forward-looking perspective within the Church's political and theological context.
