His parents were immigrants from County Kerry, Ireland. He was baptized five days after his birth at the Church of the Most Holy Redeemer in Detroit, founded and administered by the Congregation of the Most Holy Redeemer (Redemptorists). He later attended the parochial school at the church. By the time he had graduated, Tobin felt called to serve as a Catholic priest. He applied to join the Redemptorists, who accepted him as a candidate. He then attended St. Joseph's Preparatory College in Edgerton, Wisconsin, the Redemptorist minor seminary. After graduating from St. Joseph's in 1970, he was received into the Redemptorist novitiate to begin his formation as a member. Tobin made his temporary profession of religious vows as a member of the Redemptorists on August 5, 1972, and his perpetual vows on August 21, 1976. In 1975, Tobin received a Bachelor of Arts degree in philosophy from Holy Redeemer College in Waterford, Wisconsin. He then studied at Mount St. Alphonsus Seminary in Esopus, New York, earning a Master of Religious Education degree in 1977 and a Master of Divinity degree in pastoral theology in 1979. Tobin was ordained a priest for the Redemptorist Order by Archbishop William Cousins at Holy Redeemer College on June 1, 1978. The following year, Tobin returned to Detroit, where he was appointed the parochial vicar of Holy Redeemer Parish. He was later named pastor there, serving from 1984 to 1990. From 1980 to 1986, he served as an episcopal vicar for the Archdiocese of Detroit, and also assisted at the local diocesan marriage tribunal. From 1990 to 1991, Tobin served as pastor of St. Alphonsus Parish in Chicago, Illinois.

Political Analysis: Cardinal Joseph William Tobin's biography suggests a leaning towards the more progressive side of the spectrum within the Catholic Church's political and theological context, meriting a score of 0.6. His membership and leadership roles within the Redemptorist order, known for its commitment to social justice and pastoral care, indicate a predisposition towards a Church that is engaged with the world and its contemporary issues. Serving in diverse pastoral roles, including significant time in urban parishes, suggests an approach to ministry that values engagement with community needs and social issues. His educational background, emphasizing pastoral theology, further supports a focus on a Church that is responsive and adaptive to the needs of its flock rather than strictly conservative or traditionalist. Additionally, his roles within the Church's governance, particularly his work with the Congregation for Institutes of Consecrated Life and Societies of Apostolic Life, indicate experience with and possibly an inclination towards reform and renewal within the Church's life, especially in how religious life engages with modern challenges. While the text does not provide explicit details on his stances on specific doctrinal issues, his career trajectory and educational background suggest a more open, engaged, and pastoral approach, characteristic of a more progressive leaning within the Church.
