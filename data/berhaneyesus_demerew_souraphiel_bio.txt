Berhaneyesus Demerew Souraphiel, CM (Amharic: ብርሃነ ኢየሱስ ደምረው ሱራፌል; born 14 July 1948) is a prelate of the Ethiopian Catholic Church, which he has headed since his election as Archbishop of Addis Abeba in 1999. He is also the chancellor of the Catholic University of Eastern Africa and the president of the Catholic Bishops’ Conference of Ethiopia and Eritrea. He was made a cardinal by Pope Francis in 2015. He was imprisoned by the Communist government of Ethiopia in 1979–80. A member of the Congregation of the Mission, he directed the order's novitiate in the mid-1980s and was provincial superior from 1990 to 1994. He served as Auxiliary Bishop of Addis Abeba for 18 months before becoming archbishop. Berhaneyesus Demerew Souraphiel was born on 14 July 1948 in Tchela Claka, near Harar in Ethiopia. He first attended public schools and those run by the Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church, and then others run by the Capuchins and the De La Salle Brothers. He entered the minor seminary of the Congregation of the Mission (known as "Lazarists" or "Vincentians") in 1963. He studied at the Makanissa Major Seminary beginning in 1968. He studied theology at King's College London and was ordained a Catholic priest on 4 July 1976. He fulfilled parish assignments in southwestern Ethiopia until, in June 1979, he was jailed by Ethiopia's military dictatorship for seven months, including one month in solitary confinement. When the government expelled foreign missionaries, he was left with responsibility for 15 parishes in addition to his original assignment. When sent into exile himself, he earned a degree in sociology at the Pontifical Gregorian University. He returned to Ethiopia in 1983. In 1990 Berhaneyesus Souraphiel became provincial superior of the Lazarists in Addis Ababa. In 1994 he was appointed prefect of the newly created Apostolic Vicariate of Jimma-Bonga. On 7 November 1997, Pope John Paul II appointed him auxiliary bishop of Addis Abeba and he was consecrated a bishop on 25 January 1998 by Cardinal Paulos Tzadua. On 7 July 1999 he succeeded Paulos Tzadua as Ethiopian Catholic Archbishop of Addis Abeba.

Political Analysis: Cardinal Berhaneyesus Demerew Souraphiel's biography suggests a moderate leaning towards progressive views within the context of Catholic Church politics, warranting a score of 0.3. His educational background, with studies in sociology at the Pontifical Gregorian University and theology at King's College London, indicates exposure to diverse and potentially progressive ideas. His imprisonment by a Communist regime and subsequent responsibility for numerous parishes in the absence of foreign missionaries reflect resilience and a commitment to pastoral care under challenging circumstances, suggesting a pragmatic approach to Church governance and social issues. His leadership roles, including chancellor of the Catholic University of Eastern Africa and president of the Catholic Bishops’ Conference of Ethiopia and Eritrea, alongside his elevation to cardinal by Pope Francis, who is known for his relatively progressive stances, further imply a more open-minded approach to contemporary issues and Church reform. However, the absence of specific statements or actions directly addressing controversial doctrines or reforms prevents a classification as distinctly liberal. Therefore, his overall political leaning within the Church is assessed as moderately progressive.
