Political Analysis: Based on the biographical text of Ignace Bessi Dogbo, several factors suggest a moderate leaning towards progressive within the Catholic Church's political spectrum, warranting a score of 0.2. Firstly, his educational background, with a degree in exegesis from the Pontifical Biblical Institute in Rome, indicates a solid foundation in biblical scholarship, which might incline towards a more open interpretation of scripture in line with contemporary issues. His roles, particularly as diocesan director of the Pontifical Mission Societies and diocesan spiritual assistant to the Young Christian Students, suggest an engagement with the laity and a focus on pastoral care, often associated with a more progressive approach to ministry. Furthermore, his participation in the Synod of Bishops at the Vatican as an elected representative of the Ivorian bishops in 2015, under the pontificate of Pope Francis, who is known for his relatively progressive stance on various issues, might indicate his openness to discussing and possibly supporting reforms within the Church. However, the absence of explicit positions on social issues, Church doctrine, and governance in the text prevents a more definitive classification. Therefore, a slight lean towards progressivism is inferred from his educational background, pastoral roles, and engagement in Church assemblies under a progressive pontificate, without clear evidence of a strong stance on contentious doctrinal or social issues.
