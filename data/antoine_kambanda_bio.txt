Antoine Kambanda (born 10 November 1958) is a Rwandan prelate of the Catholic Church who has been Archbishop of Kigali since 2019. He was Bishop of Kibungo from 2013 to 2018. Pope Francis raised him to the rank of cardinal on 28 November 2020, making him the first cardinal from Rwanda. He is current Spiritual Protector and Chaplain General of the Orléans obedience of the Military and Hospitaller Order of Saint Lazarus of Jerusalem. Antoine Kambanda was born on 10 November 1958 in Rwanda. Because of inter-ethnic violence, his family moved briefly to Burundi and then to Uganda, where he attended elementary, and then to Kenya, where he attended high school. Later he returned to his homeland, where he attended the junior Seminary in Rutongo, Kigali, (1983–1984) and the Saint Charles Borromeo Major Seminary of Nyakibanda in Butare (1984–1990). On 8 September 1990, he was ordained a priest in Kabgayi by Pope John Paul II. After that he was Prefect of Studies from 1990 to 1993 in the minor seminary of St. Vincent in Ndera, Kigali. He then attended the Alphonsian Academy in Rome from 1993 to 1999, where he obtained a doctorate in moral theology. His parents and five of his six siblings, along with many other relatives and friends, were killed in 1994 during the genocide against the Tutsi. Kambanda was appointed Director of the diocesan office of Caritas in Kigali in 1999. He then became director of the Development Committee of the Diocese of Kigali, head of the "Justice and Peace" Commission of the diocese, and professor of moral theology and visitor at the Nyakibanda Major Seminary. Speaking in 2004 of the 1994 Rwandan genocide, Kambanda acknowledged that while some members of the Catholic clergy had tried to protect the people, others had been complicit in the killings. Kambanda noted the need for the Catholic Church itself to undergo reconstruction to shake off the effects of the genocide. He has said "the use of the sacrament of penance for reconciliation and healing of ethnic hatred and the reconciliation with oneself, with God and with the others, would be significant to develop a faith characterized by trust that overcomes the fear of the other." In September 2005 Cardinal Crescenzio Sepe appointed him rector of the inter-diocesan major philosophy seminary in Kabgayi. On 10 February 2006 Kambanda was appointed rector of the Saint Charles Borromeo Major Seminary of Nyakibanda. He replaced Monseigneur Smaragde Mbonyintege, who had been named a bishop.

Political Analysis: Cardinal Antoine Kambanda's biography suggests a leaning towards the more progressive side of the spectrum within the Catholic Church's context, meriting a score of 0.6. His focus on reconciliation and healing through the sacrament of penance in the aftermath of the Rwandan genocide indicates a pastoral approach that prioritizes mercy, forgiveness, and social healing over strict doctrinal adherence. This approach aligns with the more progressive elements within the Church that emphasize mercy and social justice. Kambanda's involvement with Caritas, a development and humanitarian organization of the Church, and his leadership in the "Justice and Peace" Commission further underscore his commitment to social issues and reform, reflecting a preference for engaging the Church in contemporary societal challenges. His educational background in moral theology, with a focus on practical applications of doctrine in the context of real-world issues, suggests an openness to nuanced interpretations of Church teachings. Additionally, being appointed by Pope Francis, known for his relatively progressive stances within the Church, and being the first cardinal from Rwanda, a country with a complex history of ethnic violence and reconciliation, positions Kambanda within a context that values innovative pastoral care and engagement with contemporary issues over strict traditionalism. However, the lack of explicit statements on contentious doctrinal issues prevents a full score towards the progressive end of the spectrum.
