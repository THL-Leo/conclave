Josip Bozanić (pronounced [jǒsip bǒzanit͡ɕ]; born 20 March 1949) is a Croatian prelate of the Catholic Church who was the Archbishop of Zagreb from 1997 to 2023. He was previously Bishop of Krk from 1989 to 1997. He was made a cardinal in 2003. Josip Bozanić was born in Rijeka, PR Croatia, Yugoslavia, the eldest of four children of Ivan Bozanić and Dinka Valković. He attended the minor seminary of Pazin and the Theological Faculties of Rijeka and Zagreb, where he obtained a Master's degree in theology. He was ordained to the priesthood on 29 June 1975 by Bishop Karmelo Zazinović, whom he then served as private secretary until 1976. He was a parish priest for three years before furthering his studies in Rome from 1979 to 1985. He earned a licentiate in dogmatic theology from the Pontifical Gregorian University and a licentiate in canon law from the Pontifical Lateran University. Upon his return to Yugoslavia, he served as chancellor (1986–1987) and vicar general (1987–1989) of the Diocese of Krk. He also taught dogmatic theology and canon law at the Theological Institute of Rijeka from 1988 to 1997. On 10 May 1989, Bozanić was appointed Coadjutor Bishop of Krk by Pope John Paul II. He received his episcopal consecration on the following 25 June from Cardinal Franjo Kuharić, with Archbishop Josip Pavlišić and Bishop Zazinović serving as co-consecrators, at Assumption Cathedral.[citation needed] At the age of 40, he was one of the youngest bishops in Europe. He succeeded as bishop of Krk on 14 November 1989.[citation needed] One of his ancestors, Bartol Bozanić, served in the same post from 1839 to 1854.

Political Analysis: Cardinal Josip Bozanić's biography suggests a leaning towards the conservative/traditionalist side within the Catholic Church's political spectrum, meriting a score of -0.5. His educational background, with a Master's degree in theology and licentiates in dogmatic theology and canon law from prestigious Pontifical Universities, indicates a strong foundation in traditional Catholic doctrine and Church law. Serving as chancellor and vicar general, and later as bishop and archbishop, Bozanić has held roles that typically involve upholding Church teachings and governance structures, which often aligns with a conservative approach to Church leadership and governance.

His appointment by Pope John Paul II, a pope known for his conservative stance on many doctrinal issues, as well as his consecration by Cardinal Franjo Kuharić, further aligns him with figures who were cautious about rapid changes within the Church. The lack of specific mentions of engagement with contemporary social issues or reforms in the text suggests that Bozanić's focus has been more on pastoral care and traditional theological education rather than on pushing for progressive changes within the Church or its teachings.

However, the absence of explicit mentions of opposition to reforms or progressive movements within the Church prevents a full -1.0 score. Without direct evidence of Bozanić's positions on various contemporary issues facing the Church (e.g., the role of women, LGBTQ+ matters, or the approach to clerical celibacy), a moderate conservative score reflects a cautious interpretation of his political leaning within the context of Catholic Church politics.
