Konrad Krajewski ([ˈkɔn.rat kraˈjɛf.ski]; born 25 November 1963) is a Polish Catholic prelate who has served as Prefect of the Dicastery for the Service of Charity since 2013. He served as Papal Master of Ceremonies from 1998 to 2013. In 2013, he was appointed as Papal Almoner to coordinate the charitable concerns of Pope Francis and lead the Office of Papal Charities; this became the Dicastery for the Service of Charity with the apostolic constitution Praedicate evangelium in June 2022. Pope Francis created Krajewski a cardinal on 28 June 2018. Konrad Krajewski was born on 25 November 1963 in Łódź, central Poland, to a family of teachers. He had an older brother, Krzysztof, who died suddenly in his sleep at the age of 29 whilst at sea. Krajewski was described by his school colleagues and mentors as a diligent and honest student, who, at the time, hoped to become an educator. Early in life, Krajewski came to be involved in the Light-Life Movement, also known as the Oasis Movement in Poland, which was aimed at the spiritual formation of parishioners during spiritual retreats. Impressed by the movement and his local priest, Krajewski decided to enter the seminary of the Archdiocese of Łódź in 1982. He subsequently earned a degree in theology from the Catholic University of Lublin and was ordained a priest on 11 June 1988. After ordination, he served the diocese for two years in pastoral work. In 1990, Krajewski continued his studies at the Liturgical Institute of St. Anselmo in Rome. On 5 March 1993, he obtained his Licentiate in Sacred Liturgy. Krajewski earned a Doctorate in Theology from the Pontifical University of Saint Thomas Aquinas in 1995 with a dissertation entitled L'ordinazione episcopale nella riforma del Concilio Vaticano II ("Episcopal ordination in the reform of Vatican II"). During his stay in Rome Krajewski collaborated with the Office for the Liturgical Celebrations of the Supreme Pontiff. He returned to his diocese in 1995 and served as master of ceremonies for the archbishop and taught Catholic liturgy at the seminary and to the Franciscans and Salesians. In 1998, he returned to Rome to work in the Office of Liturgical Celebrations of the Supreme Pontiff. On 12 May 1999, Pope John Paul II appointed him a Papal Master of Ceremonies. Krajewski helped plan and execute all major public liturgical events presided over by the Pope, including Christmas and Easter Masses, canonizations, consistory ceremonies, and conclaves. He was tasked with ensuring that rituals were carried out in an appropriate manner and according to custom. On 3 August 2013, Pope Francis appointed him Papal Almoner, the formal title of which office is "Almoner of His Holiness." At the same time, he was made Titular Archbishop of Beneventum. He was consecrated on 17 September 2013 by Cardinal Giuseppe Bertello with Archbishops Piero Marini and Władysław Ziółek as co-consecrators. Pope Francis attended the consecration.

Political Analysis: Cardinal Konrad Krajewski's biographical details suggest a leaning towards the liberal/progressive end of the spectrum within the context of Catholic Church politics and theology. Several factors contribute to this assessment:

1. **Close Association with Pope Francis**: His appointment as Papal Almoner and later as Prefect of the Dicastery for the Service of Charity by Pope Francis, who is known for his more progressive stances on various issues, indicates a shared vision and approach to the Church's mission in the world. Pope Francis' choice to elevate Krajewski to these positions, especially creating a dicastery focused on charity, aligns with a more open, service-oriented, and inclusive Church, reflecting a progressive stance.

2. **Role in Charitable Works**: Leading the Office of Papal Charities and coordinating the charitable concerns of Pope Francis places Krajewski at the forefront of the Church's engagement with social issues. His direct involvement in acts of charity, as indicated by his role, suggests a practical application of faith that prioritizes social justice and care for the marginalized, which are often associated with more progressive elements within the Church.

3. **Educational and Professional Background**: Krajewski's advanced studies in liturgy and theology, particularly his dissertation on episcopal ordination in the context of Vatican II reforms, suggest an openness to liturgical and ecclesiological renewal. Vatican II is often cited as a turning point towards a more pastoral, inclusive, and world-engaged Church, and Krajewski's academic focus on its reforms indicates a leaning towards these more progressive ideals.

4. **Pastoral Work and Spiritual Formation Involvement**: His early involvement in the Light-Life Movement, aimed at the spiritual formation of parishioners, and his pastoral work in the diocese point towards a person-centered approach to ministry. This approach often correlates with a more progressive view on pastoral care, emphasizing personal spiritual growth and active participation in the faith community.

5. **Liturgical Role**: Serving as Papal Master of Ceremonies and collaborating with the Office for the Liturgical Celebrations of the Supreme Pontiff, Krajewski was involved in planning and executing major liturgical events. While this role is deeply rooted in tradition, his overall trajectory and focus on Vatican II reforms suggest a balanced approach that respects tradition but is also open to liturgical expressions that engage contemporary faith communities in meaningful ways.

Given these factors, Krajewski's political leaning within the Church is assessed as significantly more progressive, focusing on social justice, inclusivity, and a pastoral approach that is responsive to contemporary challenges.
