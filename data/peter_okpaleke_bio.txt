Peter Ebere Okpaleke listenⓘ (born 1 March 1963) is a Nigerian prelate and cardinal of the Catholic Church who has been Bishop of Ekwulobia since 29 April 2020. He was appointed Bishop of Ahiara in 2012 and consecrated in 2013, but after the local clergy and laity insisted on an Mbaise bishop instead he was installed as bishop of Ekwulobia. He was elevated to cardinal by Pope Francis on 27 August, 2022. Peter Ebere Okpaleke born on 1 March 1963 in Amesi in Anambra State, Nigeria. He attended local schools and in 1983 entered the Bigard Memorial Major Seminary in Ikot-Ekpene and Enugu, where he studied philosophy and theology from 1983 to 1992. He was ordained a priest of the Diocese of Awka on 22 August 1990. In the twenty years following his ordination he filled a wide variety of pastoral and administrative positions, including university chaplain, parish priest, diocesan finance administrator, diocesan chancellor, and secretary and member of diocesan boards. He also studied canon law in Rome at the Pontifical University of the Holy Cross. On 7 December 2012, Pope Benedict XVI appointed Okpaleke Bishop of Ahiara, Nigeria. Okpaleke was consecrated a bishop on 21 May 2013. Because of objections to his appointment, his consecration was held outside the Diocese, in the Major Seminary of Ulakwo in the Archdiocese of Owerri. Local clergy and parishioners objected to his appointment and prevented him from entering the cathedral in order to take possession of the diocese. A petition objecting to the fact that Okpaleke was not of the area's Mbaise ethnic origin was sent to Pope Benedict after he appointed Okpaleke bishop. On 9 June 2017, Pope Francis gave clergy in the diocese 30 days to either write a letter promising obedience and accepting Okpaleke as their bishop or be suspended. Clergy sent letters of apology but continued to protest what they saw as racial discrimination.

Political Analysis: Cardinal Peter Ebere Okpaleke's biography suggests a moderate leaning with a slight tilt towards progressivism within the Catholic Church's political spectrum. His educational background in canon law and his variety of roles in pastoral and administrative positions indicate a deep understanding of Church doctrine and governance, which often aligns with a more conservative approach to Church tradition and doctrine. However, the circumstances surrounding his bishopric—especially his appointment by Pope Benedict XVI to Ahiara and the subsequent conflict over ethnic origins, followed by his support from Pope Francis, who is known for his more progressive stances on various issues—suggest an openness to reform and dialogue within the Church. Pope Francis's intervention on his behalf and Okpaleke's acceptance of a new diocese despite the controversy signal a willingness to prioritize unity and pastoral care over strict adherence to traditionalist views on ecclesiastical appointments. Furthermore, his studies in Rome and varied pastoral experiences indicate an engagement with contemporary issues facing the Church, suggesting a balanced approach to governance that leans slightly towards progressivism. However, without explicit statements on social issues, reforms, or specific theological positions, it is prudent to place him closer to the center, indicating a moderate with a slight progressive inclination.
