Jean-Marc Noël Aveline (French pronunciation: [ʒɑ̃maʁk av(ə)lin]; born 26 December 1958) is a French Catholic prelate who has served as Archbishop of Marseille since 2019. He was previously an auxiliary bishop there from 2013 to 2019. Pope Francis made him a cardinal in 2022. Aveline was named by several media outlets as papabile, meaning he was a possible candidate in the 2025 papal conclave. Jean-Marc Aveline was born on 26 December 1958 in Sidi Bel Abbes, in French Algeria. In 1966 his family moved to Marseille. His father was a railway worker and the family lived in SNCF housing in the Saint-Barthélemy neighborhood. He was educated in Marseille at Lycée Victor-Hugo and then for two years at Lycée Thiers [fr]. He studied at the inter-diocesan seminary of Avignon from 1977 to 1979. He then joined the Carmes Seminary of Paris to study at the Catholic University of Paris where he earned a doctorate in theology in 2000. He also earned a licenciate in philosophy at the Sorbonne. He was ordained a priest of the Archdiocese of Marseille on 3 November 1984. He taught theology and taught at the seminary in Aix-en-Provence and performed parish work at the Saint-Marcel parish.

Political Analysis: Jean-Marc Noël Aveline's biography suggests a leaning towards the liberal/progressive end of the spectrum within the Catholic Church's context, meriting a score of 0.7. Several factors contribute to this assessment:

1. **Educational Background and Intellectual Engagement**: Aveline's extensive education, including a doctorate in theology from the Catholic University of Paris and a licenciate in philosophy from the Sorbonne, indicates a deep engagement with contemporary theological and philosophical thought. His leadership roles at the Institut des sciences et de théologie des religions of Marseille (ISTR) and the Catholic Institute of the Mediterranean, both institutions known for fostering dialogue between faiths and cultures, suggest an openness to interreligious dialogue and a progressive approach to theology.

2. **Pastoral and Administrative Work**: His long tenure as episcopal vicar for permanent formation and his involvement in vocation service and parish work point to a pastoral approach that values ongoing education and formation. This emphasis on formation, especially in contexts that encourage engagement with a broad spectrum of religious and cultural ideas, aligns with a more progressive stance on pastoral care and ecclesial engagement with the modern world.

3. **Papal Appointment**: Being made a cardinal by Pope Francis in 2022 further hints at a progressive leaning. Pope Francis is known for appointing cardinals who are pastoral, open to dialogue, and engaged with social issues, aligning with his vision of a Church that goes out to the peripheries. Aveline's selection by Francis could be seen as an endorsement of a more open, dialogical approach to Church leadership and governance.

4. **Engagement with Contemporary Issues**: While the text does not provide explicit examples of Aveline's views on specific social issues or reforms, his educational and leadership roles in institutions that promote intercultural and interreligious dialogue suggest a willingness to engage with contemporary societal and ecclesiastical challenges in a progressive manner.

In summary, Aveline's background in education, his pastoral approach, and his alignment with Pope Francis's vision of the Church suggest a cardinal who leans towards the liberal/progressive end of the spectrum within the Catholic Church.
