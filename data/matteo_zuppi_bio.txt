Matteo Maria Zuppi ([matˈtɛːo maˈriːa tˈtsuppi, - dˈdzuppi]; born 11 October 1955) is an Italian Roman Catholic prelate who has served as Archbishop of Bologna since 2015. He was previously an auxiliary bishop of Rome from 2012 to 2015. Pope Francis made him a cardinal in 2019. He has been president of the Episcopal Conference of Italy since 2022. During this time, Zuppi opposed right-wing populism, nationalism and anti-immigrant beliefs, emphasizing Europe's moral duty to welcome migrants. These views resulted in clashes with Matteo Salvini, leader of Italy's Lega Party, alongside other individuals of the Italian right. He was a voice of support for the 2018 Vatican-China Agreement, which allows the pope to approve and veto bishops approved by the Chinese Communist Party. He has written three books on Catholicism and additionally contributed an essay to the Italian translation of James Martin's Building a Bridge. As a close associate of Pope Francis, who supported many of his initiatives, Zuppi was seen as a leading contender in the 2025 papal conclave. Born in Rome on 11 October 1955, he is the fifth of six children of the journalist Enrico Zuppi, and Carla Fumagalli (d. 2005), niece of Cardinal Carlo Confalonieri.[citation needed] He attended the Liceo Virgilio there and then he studied at the seminary in Palestrina and earned his Bachelor of Sacred Theology at the Pontifical Lateran University in Rome. He earned a laurea at the Sapienza University of Rome, writing his thesis on the history of Christianity. He was ordained a priest of the Diocese of Palestrina on 9 May 1981 and in that year was appointed as the parochial vicar of Basilica of Santa Maria in Trastevere under Vincenzo Paglia, whom he succeeded as pastor of the church, serving from 2000 to 2010. He was incardinated into the Archdiocese of Rome in 1988. He worked with the Community of Sant'Egidio, a Catholic lay association devoted to ecumenism and conflict resolution. Zuppi was one of the four mediators of the two-year-long Rome-based peace negotiations that resulted in the Rome General Peace Accords and helped end the civil war in Mozambique in 1992, in recognition of which he was made an honorary citizen of that country. Zuppi also traveled to Turkey in 1993 in an attempt to secure the release of two Italian tourists held by Kurdish rebels. On 31 January 2012, Pope Benedict XVI named him an Auxiliary Bishop of the Diocese of Rome and titular bishop of Villa Nova. He was ordained a bishop on 14 April 2012 by Cardinal Agostino Vallini, Vicar General of the Diocese of Rome. He was the auxiliary responsible for the city center, including the Trastevere neighborhood where Sant'Egidio is headquartered. There he led efforts to improve care for the poor and the elderly and developed outreach programs for drug addicts and romani. He also established relations with traditionalists and celebrated a Pontifical Mass according to the Tridentine rite.

Political Analysis: Cardinal Matteo Maria Zuppi's biographical text indicates a strong leaning towards the liberal/progressive end of the spectrum within the context of Catholic Church politics and theology. His opposition to right-wing populism, nationalism, and anti-immigrant beliefs, alongside his emphasis on Europe's moral duty to welcome migrants, showcases a progressive stance on social issues. His support for the Vatican-China Agreement, which seeks a middle ground with the Chinese Communist Party regarding the appointment of bishops, suggests a pragmatic approach to Church governance and international relations, aligning with more progressive views on engagement with contemporary geopolitical issues. Furthermore, his association with the Community of Sant'Egidio, known for its commitment to social justice, ecumenism, and conflict resolution, and his efforts to improve care for marginalized groups, reflect a pastoral care approach that prioritizes inclusivity and social justice. His willingness to engage with traditionalists and celebrate the Tridentine Mass indicates a respect for Church tradition, yet his overall actions and positions suggest a primary alignment with progressive values. Therefore, a score of 0.8 is appropriate, reflecting a strong but not extreme progressive orientation within the Church.
