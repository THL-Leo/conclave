Jozef De Kesel (born 17 June 1947) is a Belgian Catholic prelate who served as Archbishop of Mechelen-Brussels from 2015 to 2023. He previously served there as auxiliary bishop from 2002 to 2010. He served as Bishop of Bruges from 2010 to 2015 and was made a cardinal in 2016. De Kesel was born on 17 June 1947 in Ghent, the sixth of eleven children. He entered the seminary in 1965, studied philosophy and theology at the seminary of Saint-Paul in Ghent and received his degree in Philosophy and Letters at the Catholic University of Leuven. From 1968 until 1972 he studied theology in Rome at the Pontifical Gregorian University, he gained first his license and then in 1977 his doctorate. He was ordained a priest for the Diocese of Ghent on 26 August 1972 by his uncle Leo-Karel De Kesel, an auxiliary bishop of Ghent. While in Ghent he taught religious education at the diocesan secondary school in Eeklo from 1974 to 1980 and led courses in religion, philosophical anthropology and contemporary thought at Artevelde University of Applied Sciences (Sociale Hogeschool Gent) from 1977 to 1980. He was professor of fundamental theology and dogmatic theology at the Major Seminary of Ghent from 1980 to 1996 and at the same time, Professor of Theology at the Higher Institute of Religious Sciences in Ghent, where he was also dean. He was professor of Christology at the Catholic University of Leuven from 1989 to 1992. He also had responsibility for the formation of pastoral workers in Ghent from 1983 to 2002 and was episcopal vicar for theological and pastoral training in the diocese of Ghent from 1992 to 2002. Pope John Paul II appointed him titular bishop of Bulna and auxiliary of Mechelen-Brussel on 20 March 2002. As his episcopal motto he chose the words of St. Augustine "Like you I am a Christian". He later explained he dropped the preceding words ("I am a bishop for you") to underscore his "first vocation" as a follower of Christ. He was consecrated on 26 May and appointed Vicar General for the vicariate of Brussels. While serving as auxiliary, in the Belgian bishops' conference he was responsible for the inter-diocesan Commission for Pastoral Liturgy (Flemish and French) and a delegate to the Commission of the Bishops' Conferences of the European Community (COMECE). When Cardinal Godfried Danneels, Archbishop of Mechelen-Brussels, reached retirement age in 2008, the Nuncio to Belgium, Archbishop Karl-Josef Rauber, recommended De Kesel to succeed him, a candidacy supported by Danneels as well. Pope Benedict XVI ignored Rauber's recommendation and De Kesel remained an auxiliary. The affair was recalled in later years as Pope Francis took a different stance, making Rauber a cardinal, moving De Kesel to Mechelen-Brussels, and then making De Kesel a cardinal as well.

Political Analysis: Cardinal Jozef De Kesel's biography suggests a leaning towards the liberal/progressive end of the spectrum within the Catholic Church's political and theological context. His educational background, with a strong emphasis on philosophy, theology, and contemporary thought, alongside his teaching positions in religious education, fundamental theology, dogmatic theology, and Christology, indicate a deep engagement with both traditional Catholic doctrine and contemporary issues. His choice of episcopal motto, emphasizing his identity as a Christian first, suggests a pastoral approach that values inclusivity and the shared Christian identity over hierarchical distinctions, aligning with more progressive views on Church governance and pastoral care.

De Kesel's involvement with the inter-diocesan Commission for Pastoral Liturgy and his role as a delegate to the Commission of the Bishops' Conferences of the European Community (COMECE) point towards an active engagement with contemporary issues facing the Church in Europe, including potentially social justice, migration, and ecumenism, which are often associated with more progressive stances within the Church. Furthermore, the narrative of his appointment as Archbishop of Mechelen-Brussels, succeeding Cardinal Danneels and the support from figures like Archbishop Karl-Josef Rauber and Pope Francis, both known for their more progressive views, suggests that De Kesel is viewed favorably by those within the Church who are inclined towards reform and modernization. The delay in his appointment by Pope Benedict XVI, a pontiff with a more conservative reputation, further underscores the perception of De Kesel as more aligned with progressive elements within the Church. 

However, the lack of explicit mention of his stances on hot-button social issues (e.g., LGBT rights, celibacy for priests, women's ordination) prevents a full score towards the liberal extreme. Thus, a score of 0.6 is justified, indicating a clear but not extreme progressive leaning.
