Political Analysis: Cardinal Malcolm Ranjith's biographical information suggests a leaning towards the conservative/traditionalist end of the spectrum within the Catholic Church's political context, meriting a score of -0.7. His extensive service in various capacities within the Church, including roles deeply involved with doctrine and liturgy such as the Secretary of the Congregation for Divine Worship and the Discipline of the Sacraments, typically aligns with a more conservative approach to Church governance and liturgical practices. The Congregation for Divine Worship is known for its focus on preserving traditional liturgical norms and practices, which often attracts clergy with conservative leanings. Additionally, his educational background in theology from the Pontifical Urban College and further studies at the Pontifical Biblical Institute and the Hebrew University in Jerusalem indicate a deep engagement with traditional Church teachings and scripture, further suggesting a conservative theological orientation. While the text does not provide explicit details on his stances on social issues, reform, or contemporary issues, his roles and educational background imply a preference for continuity over change, characteristic of a conservative approach within the Church's political and theological spectrum.
