Goh continued his studies in Rome, receiving a licentiate in dogmatic theology from the Pontifical Gregorian University. Returning to Singapore, he was posted as a Resident Formator and Initiation Year Director at the Major Seminary and lecturer in systematic theology.

Political Analysis: Cardinal William Goh Seng Chye's biography suggests a moderate leaning towards progressive within the Catholic Church's context, meriting a score of 0.3. His educational background, with advanced degrees in theology from prestigious institutions like the Pontifical Urbaniana University and the Pontifical Gregorian University, indicates a deep engagement with Church doctrine and tradition. However, the absence of explicit mentions of conservative or traditionalist stances in his biography, combined with his roles in various youth and spirituality ministries, suggests an openness to engaging with contemporary issues and a pastoral approach that values engagement over strict doctrinal enforcement.

His appointment by Pope Francis, known for his relatively progressive stance on various issues within the Church, further supports a leaning towards a more open and engaging approach to Church governance and social issues. Additionally, Goh's involvement with the Federation of Asian Bishops' Conferences and his leadership roles within the seminary system indicate a commitment to theological education and possibly to the evolution of Church teachings in response to modern challenges.

The mention of "close and cooperative relations" with the Singaporean government, as noted by the Prime Minister, suggests a pragmatic approach to governance and social engagement, prioritizing collaboration over confrontation. This approach, while not directly indicative of his theological positions, suggests a leadership style that is more inclusive and open to dialogue, aligning with a more moderate to progressive stance within the Church's political spectrum. However, without explicit statements or actions on specific doctrinal reforms or social issues, it is prudent to classify Cardinal Goh as moderately progressive, reflecting a balance between tradition and adaptation to contemporary challenges.
