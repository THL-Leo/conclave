Kazimierz Nycz (Polish pronunciation: [kaˈʑi.mjɛʂ nɨt͡ʂ]; born 1 February 1950) is a Polish prelate of the Catholic Church who served as the Archbishop of Warsaw from 2007 to 2024. He was Bishop of Koszalin-Kołobrzeg from 2004 to 2007, after serving more than fifteen years as auxiliary bishop of Kraków. Pope Benedict XVI elevated him to the rank of cardinal in 2010. Kazimierz Nycz was born in Stara Wieś. Nycz was educated at the primary school in Stara Wieś; Lyceum of Maria Skłodowska-Curie, Czechowice-Dziedzice where he graduated in 1967; he then entered the Major Seminary of Kraków. He received the diaconate from Cardinal Karol Wojtyła on 8 May 1972, and was ordained to the priesthood on 20 May 1973 by Bishop Julian Groblicki. In 1976, he obtained a bachelor's degree at the Faculty of Theology of Papieska Akademia Teologiczna (Pontifical Academy of Theology), of Kraków. In 1977 he started his doctoral studies at the Catholic University of Lublin, where he earned a doctorate in catechetical studies in 1981 with a dissertation "Implementation of catechetical renewal of the Second Vatican Council in the Archdiocese of Kraków". From 1973 to 1975 he was vicar of the parish of Saint Elisabeth in Jaworzno, and he was vice-rector of the Major Seminary of Kraków from 1987 to 1988. On 14 May 1988, Nycz was appointed Auxiliary Bishop of Kraków and Titular Bishop of Villa Regis. He received his episcopal consecration on the following 4 June from Cardinal Franciszek Macharski, with Archbishops Jerzy Ablewicz and Stanisław Nowak as co-consecrators. On 26 November 1999, he was named chairman of the Committee for Catholic Education; his main interest was to seek ways to find the opportunities offered by schools for catechetical activities and to search for forms of parish catechesis. As chairman of the Commission for Education of the Conference of the Polish Episcopate, the center of his activities was adapting the Polish catechesis to the post-Vatican II catechetical documents of the Church, especially the Catechism of the Catholic Church and the General Directory for Catechesis; and to correlate the teaching of religion in the school with the requirements of the reformed schools

Political Analysis: Cardinal Kazimierz Nycz exhibits a moderate conservative stance within the Catholic Church's political spectrum. His educational background and early priesthood formation under the influence of Cardinal Karol Wojtyła (later Pope John Paul II), a known conservative figure, suggest a foundation in traditionalist views. Nycz's doctoral studies focused on the implementation of catechetical renewal post-Second Vatican Council in Kraków, indicating a respect for and adherence to the Council's reforms while maintaining a commitment to doctrinal continuity, which is a hallmark of moderate conservatism. His role as chairman of the Committee for Catholic Education and his efforts to integrate catechesis with the reformed school system reflect a willingness to engage with contemporary educational frameworks, yet within the bounds of Church doctrine and tradition. This balance between upholding traditional catechetical teachings and adapting to post-Vatican II reforms, without radical departures from established Church teachings or governance models, positions him as moderately conservative. His focus on catechesis and education, rather than overtly engaging with more divisive social or political issues directly, further underscores a conservative approach centered on doctrinal fidelity and pastoral care within established Church structures.
