Robert Sarah ([ʁɔbɛʁ saʁa]; born 15 June 1945) is a Guinean Catholic prelate who served as prefect of the Congregation for Divine Worship and the Discipline of the Sacraments from 23 November 2014 to 20 February 2021. He previously served as secretary of the Congregation for the Evangelization of Peoples under Pope John Paul II and president of the Pontifical Council Cor Unum under Pope Benedict XVI. He was made a cardinal in 2010. Following the death of Pope Francis in 2025, Sarah was mentioned as a papabile, a leading candidate for the papacy, by international media outlets such as Le Monde and The Guardian, and by Catholic publications including Crux and the Catholic Herald. Sarah was born in Ourous, a rural village in then French Guinea, on 15 June 1945, the son of cultivators and converted to Christianity from animism. He is a member of the Coniagui ethnic group in northern Guinea. In 1957, at age 12, he entered Saint Augustine Minor Seminary in Bingerville, Ivory Coast, where he studied for three years. Because in 1960 relations between newly independent Guinea and the Ivory Coast were strained, he continued his studies briefly in Conakry, Guinea, at Saint Mary of Dixinn Seminary run by the Holy Ghost Fathers, until the radical government of Guinea expropriated Church property in August 1961. After independent study at home, the Church negotiated a place for Sarah and some fellow seminarians at a government-run school in Kindia in March 1962 and then won the right to open a seminary, where Sarah earned his baccalaureate in 1964. In September of that year he was sent to study at the Grand Seminary in Nancy, France. Again, deteriorating international relations, this time between Guinea and France, forced him to interrupt his studies, and he completed his theological studies in Sébikotane, Senegal, between October 1967 and June 1969. From 1969 to 1974 he studied at the Pontifical Gregorian University in Rome, where he obtained a licentiate in theology, except for the year 1971 which he spent at the Studium Biblicum Franciscanum of Jerusalem, where he obtained a licentiate in Sacred Scriptures. Sarah speaks French, English, Spanish and Italian fluently. Sarah was ordained to the priesthood on 20 July 1969, and incardinated in the Diocese of Conakry. On 13 August 1979, Pope John Paul II appointed him Metropolitan Archbishop of Conakry. He was consecrated bishop on 8 December 1979 by Cardinal Giovanni Benelli. He served as Conakry's bishop for more than twenty years and during that tenure filled terms as president of the Guinean bishops' conference and of the Episcopal Conference of West Africa.

Political Analysis: Cardinal Robert Sarah's political leaning within the Catholic Church context can be considered very conservative/traditionalist, as indicated by a score of -0.8. This assessment is based on several factors evident from the biographical text. Firstly, his tenure as prefect of the Congregation for Divine Worship and the Discipline of the Sacraments, a department that oversees liturgical practices and sacramental discipline, often aligns with more traditionalist views on Church doctrine and liturgy. His roles under both Pope John Paul II and Pope Benedict XVI, popes known for their conservative stances on doctrine and Church governance, further suggest a traditionalist inclination. Additionally, being mentioned as a papabile following the death of Pope Francis by various media outlets, including those with a focus on Catholic news, indicates recognition of his significant influence and alignment with conservative elements within the Church. The text does not provide explicit details on his views on social issues, reform, or engagement with contemporary issues, but his prominent positions in the Church hierarchy and the respect he commands among conservative circles strongly suggest a conservative/traditionalist leaning.
