Virgílio do Carmo da Silva, SDB (born 27 November 1967) is an East Timorese Catholic prelate who was appointed Bishop of Dili on 30 January 2016. He became an archbishop when the diocese was elevated in 2019. Prior to his appointment to the episcopacy, he held various offices with the Society of St. Francis de Sales (the Salesians of Don Bosco). On 27 August 2022, Pope Francis made him a cardinal, the first from East Timor. Do Carmo da Silva was born in Venilale, in the then Baucau District, Portuguese Timor (now East Timor), and is a son of José do Carmo and Isabel da Silva. He has a younger brother, Gui do Carmo da Silva; both are Salesian priests. Do Carmo da Silva attended Salesian primary and secondary schools in Fatumaca [de], Baucau District. In August 2022, shortly before being created and proclaimed cardinal priest, he told Vatican News:

Political Analysis: Based on the information provided, it is challenging to precisely place Cardinal Virgílio do Carmo da Silva on a conservative-liberal spectrum within the context of Catholic Church politics and theology. The text does not offer specific insights into his stances on Church doctrine and tradition, views on social issues and reform, approach to pastoral care, position on Church governance, engagement with contemporary issues, or theological positions. His background as a member of the Salesians of Don Bosco suggests a commitment to education and the pastoral care of young people, which are central to the Salesian charism but do not inherently indicate a particular political leaning within the Church. His historic appointment as the first cardinal from East Timor highlights his significance within the Church, yet without more detailed information on his views and actions, it is most accurate to assign a neutral score.
