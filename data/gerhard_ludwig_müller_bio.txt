Gerhard Ludwig Müller (pronounced [ˈɡeːɐ̯haʁt ˈluːtvɪç ˈmʏlɐ]; born 31 December 1947) is a German Catholic prelate who served as the Cardinal-Prefect of the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith from his appointment by Pope Benedict XVI in 2012 until 2017. Pope Francis elevated him to the rank of cardinal in 2014. Gerhard Ludwig Müller was born in Finthen, a borough of Mainz, then in Allied-occupied Germany. After graduating from Willigis Episcopal High School in Mainz, he studied philosophy and theology in Mainz, Munich, and Freiburg, West Germany. In 1977, he received his Doctorate in Theology under Karl Lehmann for his thesis on the Protestant theologian Dietrich Bonhoeffer and pursued an Habilitation, qualifying him for a chair in 1985, also under Lehmann on the theology of the "communion of saints". Müller was ordained as a priest of the Diocese of Mainz, Germany, on 11 February 1978 by cardinal Hermann Volk. He then served as a pastor of three parishes. In 1986, Müller was appointed to the chair of dogmatic theology of the Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich, where he remains an honorary professor. Pope John Paul II appointed him as Bishop of Regensburg, Germany, on 1 October 2002. He was ordained to the episcopacy on 24 November 2002, with Friedrich Wetter serving as the principal consecrator; his principal co-consecrators included Karl Lehmann, Vinzenz Guggenberger, and Manfred Müller. Gerhard Ludwig Müller elected "Dominus Iesus" ("Jesus is Lord") as his episcopal motto, which is derived from Romans 10:9. On 20 December 2007, Pope Benedict XVI reappointed Müller for another five years as a member of the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith (CDF). On 17 January 2009, he was also appointed as a member of the Pontifical Council for Culture. On 12 June 2012, Müller was appointed as a member of the Congregation for Catholic Education for a renewable term of five years and was also appointed a member of the Pontifical Council for Promoting Christian Unity.

Political Analysis: Cardinal Gerhard Ludwig Müller's career and theological positions suggest a conservative leaning within the Catholic Church's political spectrum. His appointment as the Prefect of the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith (CDF) by Pope Benedict XVI, a pope known for his conservative stance on Church doctrine and tradition, indicates Müller's alignment with traditionalist views. The CDF is responsible for promoting and safeguarding doctrine on faith and morals throughout the Catholic world, a role that typically aligns with conservative theological positions. Müller's doctoral thesis on Dietrich Bonhoeffer, although engaging with a Protestant theologian known for his resistance to Nazi ideology, does not necessarily indicate liberal theological leanings, given Bonhoeffer's complex and not easily categorized theological positions. Furthermore, Müller's selection of "Dominus Iesus" ("Jesus is Lord") as his episcopal motto, derived from a passage emphasizing belief in Christ for salvation, underscores a commitment to core Christian doctrine that is often emphasized more in conservative circles. His continued role as an honorary professor of dogmatic theology also suggests a deep engagement with traditional doctrinal teaching. While his membership in the Pontifical Council for Culture and the Pontifical Council for Promoting Christian Unity might suggest openness to dialogue and cultural engagement, these roles do not directly indicate a liberal stance on Church doctrine, governance, or social issues. Therefore, based on the available information, Müller's overall political leaning within the Church context is assessed as very conservative/traditionalist.
