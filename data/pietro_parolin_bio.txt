Pietro Parolin OMRI (Italian: [ˈpjɛːtro paroˈlin], Venetian: [paɾoˈliŋ]; born 17 January 1955) is an Italian Catholic prelate who has served as the Vatican's Secretary of State since 2013 and as a member of the Council of Cardinals since 2014, the same year he was made a cardinal. Before his tenure as secretary of state, Parolin worked in the diplomatic service of the Holy See for 30 years, where his assignments included terms in Nigeria, Mexico and Venezuela, as well as more than six years as Undersecretary of State for Relations with States. Parolin set the Vatican's foreign policy stances under Pope Francis. Parolin was one of the primary architects of the Vatican's 2018 agreement with China, which allows the pope to approve and veto bishops approved by the Chinese Communist Party. During the 2025 papal conclave, Parolin was considered papabile, a leading candidate to succeed Francis. Parolin was born in Schiavon, Province of Vicenza, the son of a hardware store manager, Luigi Parolin (1921–1965), and an elementary school teacher, Ada Miotti (1928–2024). He has one sister and a brother. When he was ten years old, his father died in a car accident. After he was ordained on 27 April 1980, he took up graduate studies in canon law at the Pontifical Gregorian University and in diplomacy at the Pontifical Ecclesiastical Academy. He entered the Holy See's diplomatic service in 1986 at the age of 31. He served for three years in the Nunciature of Nigeria where he became familiar with the problems in Christian–Muslim relations. At the Nunciature of Mexico from 1989 to 1992, Parolin contributed to the final phase of the work begun by Archbishop Girolamo Prigione which led to the legal recognition of the Catholic Church in 1992 and the establishment of diplomatic relations between the Holy See and Mexico after 130 years. These negotiations led to Mexico officially shedding the country's secular and anti-clerical imprint, which extended to its Constitution. Working in Rome, he was country director[clarification needed] for Spain, Andorra, Italy, and San Marino. Since 2000 he has worked with the then-Bishop Attilio Nicora on the implementation of the revision of the Lateran Concordat of 1984, with particular reference to the Italian military ordinariate.

Political Analysis: Cardinal Pietro Parolin's career and actions suggest a centrist leaning with a slight tilt towards conservatism within the Catholic Church's political spectrum. His long tenure in the Vatican's diplomatic service, including his significant role in the Vatican's 2018 agreement with China, demonstrates a pragmatic approach to Church governance and international relations, aiming to maintain the Church's influence and presence in challenging environments. This agreement, which involved a compromise with the Chinese Communist Party regarding the appointment of bishops, indicates a willingness to engage with contemporary political issues and to make concessions, a stance that might be viewed with skepticism by more conservative elements within the Church who prioritize doctrinal purity and autonomy over pragmatic diplomacy.

Parolin's involvement in the legal recognition of the Catholic Church in Mexico and the establishment of diplomatic relations after 130 years of secular and anti-clerical policies further showcases his effective diplomatic skills and his commitment to enhancing the Church's role in the public square, aligning with a more traditional view of seeking to restore and maintain the Church's influence in societal affairs.

His academic background in canon law and diplomacy, combined with his pastoral work in countries with significant Christian-Muslim relations, suggests a balanced approach to pastoral care, emphasizing dialogue and reconciliation, which are not strictly conservative or liberal positions but rather indicate a nuanced understanding of the Church's role in diverse societies.

Overall, Parolin's career reflects a blend of tradition and pragmatism, aiming to preserve the Church's teachings and influence while also engaging with contemporary global issues and challenges. This blend positions him slightly towards the conservative side of the spectrum, given his focus on Church diplomacy, governance, and tradition, but not so far as to be considered very conservative or traditionalist, as his actions also reflect a degree of openness to dialogue and adaptation.
