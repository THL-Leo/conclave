Fernando Filoni (born 15 April 1946) is an Italian cardinal of the Catholic Church who serves as Grand Master of the Equestrian Order of the Holy Sepulchre. He was Prefect of the Congregation for the Evangelization of Peoples from 2011 to 2019. He is an expert in Chinese affairs and on the Middle East. Filoni was born in Manduria near Taranto, Italy. He entered the seminary and earned doctorates in Philosophy and in Canon Law from the Pontifical Lateran University. He was ordained a priest on 3 July 1970. He served in the Nunciatures of Sri Lanka from 1981 until 1983, Iran from 1983 to 1985, Brazil from 1989 to 1992 and the Philippines from 1992 until 2000. Although formally assigned to the Apostolic Nunciature to the Philippines, he was based in Hong Kong. During this time Archbishop Filoni was Pope John Paul II's bridge to China's bishops, official and non-official Churches and bishops, in the hope of reconciling them to the Holy See. Pope John Paul II appointed Filoni as apostolic nuncio to Iraq and Jordan on 17 January 2001, naming him titular Archbishop of Volturnum. He received episcopal consecration from Pope John Paul II on 19 March 2001. He chose Lumen Gentium Christus as his episcopal motto. Archbishop Filoni defended the freedom of the Catholic Church in Iraq under the regime of Saddam Hussein and – in line with the Pope's position – opposed the US invasion of the country in 2003. He remained in Baghdad as American bombs fell, which he called "nothing exceptional". When Mario Vargas Llosa visited him in Baghdad in 2003, he described Filoni as "small, astute, tough as nails, talkative and an expert on emergencies", who described sadly how, just as predicted, it was "incredibly difficult to administer the peace". After the fall of Saddam he recognized the new-found freedom enjoyed by the people, but he warned against the lack of security and the slow development of the economy. He expressed mixed feelings towards the new constitution, which he described as both a "positive step towards normalization in the country" and "contradictory in some areas", and supported the peaceful coexistence between Christians and Muslims. He came close to being killed in Baghdad on 1 February 2006, when a car bomb exploded next to the nunciature. He served in Iraq and Jordan until 25 February 2006 when he was named Apostolic Nuncio to the Philippines.

Political Analysis: Cardinal Fernando Filoni's biography suggests a moderate conservative leaning within the Catholic Church context, meriting a score of -0.2. His background indicates a strong commitment to Church doctrine and tradition, as evidenced by his roles in various diplomatic and leadership positions within the Church, including his service as Prefect of the Congregation for the Evangelization of Peoples and as Grand Master of the Equestrian Order of the Holy Sepulchre. His doctoral studies in Philosophy and Canon Law at the Pontifical Lateran University further underscore his deep engagement with the Church's intellectual and legal foundations.

Filoni's stance on social issues and reform, particularly his nuanced approach to the situation in Iraq, reflects a balance between advocating for the freedom of the Catholic Church and recognizing the complexities of post-conflict reconciliation and nation-building. His opposition to the US invasion of Iraq, in alignment with Pope John Paul II's position, and his efforts to foster peaceful coexistence between Christians and Muslims, demonstrate a commitment to peace and a cautious approach to international interventionism.

His pastoral care is evident in his decision to remain in Baghdad during the bombing, showcasing a dedication to his flock under duress. This act, along with his work as a bridge between the Vatican and China's bishops, indicates a pragmatic approach to pastoral and diplomatic missions, aiming to maintain Church unity and extend its influence under challenging circumstances.

On Church governance, Filoni's roles have generally aligned with the conservative elements of the Vatican's administration, focusing on evangelization and the maintenance of traditional Church structures and roles. However, his engagement with contemporary issues, such as international relations and interfaith dialogue, suggests a willingness to navigate the modern world's complexities, albeit from a standpoint that prioritizes the Church's doctrinal integrity and historical identity.

Overall, Filoni's theological positions and actions suggest a conservative orientation that is nonetheless open to dialogue and adaptation in the face of contemporary global challenges. This places him on the conservative side of the spectrum but not at its extreme, reflecting a moderate conservatism that values tradition while engaging with the present.
