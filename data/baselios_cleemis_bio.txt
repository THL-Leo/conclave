Political Analysis: Cardinal Baselios Cleemis exhibits characteristics that suggest a moderate leaning towards progressive within the Catholic Church's political spectrum, though not extremely so. His educational background in Ecumenical Theology, emphasizing unity among Christian denominations, indicates an openness to dialogue and collaboration, which aligns more with progressive stances within the Church. His involvement in the Pontifical Council for Interreligious Dialogue further underscores a commitment to openness and engagement with other faiths, a stance typically more associated with progressive elements within the Church. Additionally, his leadership roles, both as the President of the Catholic Bishops' Conference of India and the Kerala Catholic Bishops' Council, suggest an active engagement with contemporary issues facing the Church in India, potentially including social justice and interfaith concerns, which are often areas of focus for more progressive Church leaders. However, there is no explicit mention of his stance on hot-button issues such as ordination of women, LGBTQ+ rights, or Church reform on matters of celibacy and sexual abuse, which prevents a full tilt towards a more progressive score. His elevation by Pope Benedict XVI, known for his conservative stance, and the lack of explicit advocacy for radical reforms within the Church, suggests a balance between tradition and progress, hence the moderate score.
