Pablo Virgilio "Ambo" Siongco David (born March 2, 1959) is a Filipino Catholic prelate who has served as Bishop of Kalookan since 2016. He was auxiliary bishop of San Fernando from 2006 to 2015. He has been president of the Catholic Bishops' Conference of the Philippines since 2021. Pope Francis made him a cardinal on December 7, 2024. He prefers to be known by his nickname "Ambo" or "Apu Ambo", which means "grandfather Ambo". Pablo Virgilio David was born in Betis, Guagua, Pampanga, on March 2, 1959. He is the 10th of the 13 children of Pedro David and Bienvenida Siongco. One of his siblings is the sociologist and public intellectual Randy David. He determined his vocation early and asked to attend the minor seminary at the age of ten. From 1970 to 1974 he attended Mother of Good Counsel Minor Seminary in San Fernando, Pampanga, for his secondary education. He earned his bachelor's degree in pre-divinity studies from Ateneo de Manila University in 1978, studied for several years at San Jose Seminary in Loyola Heights, Quezon City, and received his master's degree in theology from the Loyola School of Theology in 1984. During his student years he participated in demonstrations against the Marcos dictatorship. David was ordained a priest of the Archdiocese of San Fernando by Archbishop Oscar Cruz on March 12, 1983. He worked first for a year as an assistant pastor, where he continued his anti-government political activities. He then became director of his alma mater, Mother of Good Counsel Seminary, until 1986. From 1986 to 1991, he studied abroad, earning a licentiate and then a doctorate in sacred theology from the Catholic University of Louvain, a school he chose because of its "progressive" reputation, and he studied at the École biblique et archéologique française de Jérusalem, where he learned Aramaic to enable him to continue his scholarly work on the Book of Daniel. Returning to the Philippines, David held various leadership and teaching roles at Mother of Good Counsel Seminary. In 2002, he became director of the seminary's Theology Department, while continuing to teach Sacred Scripture. Also in 2002, he was elected vice-president of the Association of Catholic Biblical Scholars of the Philippines and vice-president of the Archdiocesan Media Apostolate Networks.

Political Analysis: Cardinal Pablo Virgilio David's biography indicates a strong leaning towards the liberal/progressive end of the spectrum within the context of Catholic Church politics and theology. Several key aspects of his background and actions support this assessment:

1. **Engagement in Anti-Government Political Activities**: His active participation in demonstrations against the Marcos dictatorship and continued anti-government political activities as an assistant pastor suggest a willingness to challenge established authority in the pursuit of justice, aligning with more progressive stances on social and political issues.

2. **Education and Influences**: David's choice of the Catholic University of Louvain for its "progressive" reputation and his studies at the École biblique et archéologique française de Jérusalem, where he learned Aramaic to study the Book of Daniel, indicate a strong inclination towards academic and theological openness. This openness is often associated with more liberal approaches to theology and biblical scholarship.

3. **Leadership in Progressive Organizations**: His roles as vice-president of the Association of Catholic Biblical Scholars of the Philippines and the Archdiocesan Media Apostolate Networks, combined with his directorship at the seminary's Theology Department, suggest a commitment to advancing a more engaged and possibly reformist vision of Church engagement with society.

4. **Pastoral Approach**: While the text does not provide explicit details on his pastoral care approach, his overall profile, including his nickname "Apu Ambo" (grandfather Ambo), suggests a personable, accessible approach to ministry. This accessibility often correlates with a more progressive stance on pastoral care, emphasizing inclusivity and engagement with the laity.

5. **Position on Church Governance and Doctrine**: Although the text does not detail his specific views on Church governance and doctrine, his educational background, political activism, and leadership roles imply a preference for a more collegial, consultative approach to governance and a potentially more open interpretation of doctrine, aligning with progressive theological positions.

In summary, Cardinal David's background and activities suggest a strong progressive orientation, characterized by a commitment to social justice, openness in theological scholarship, and an inclusive approach to pastoral care and Church governance.
