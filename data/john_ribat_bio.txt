Political Analysis: Cardinal Sir John Ribat's biography suggests a moderate to slightly progressive leaning within the Catholic Church's political spectrum, meriting a score of 0.3. His membership and leadership roles within the Missionaries of the Sacred Heart of Jesus indicate a commitment to pastoral care and social issues, which often align with more progressive views within the Church. His work as a parish priest and master of novices, along with his studies in Manila, suggest an openness to diverse perspectives and an emphasis on education and formation, which are indicative of a more progressive approach to pastoral care and possibly to Church governance. The fact that he was named a cardinal by Pope Francis, who has been known to appoint cardinals with a pastoral focus and who are open to addressing contemporary issues, further supports a leaning towards the progressive side. However, there is no explicit mention of his stance on specific doctrinal issues, social reforms, or engagement with contemporary societal issues, which prevents a classification of him as strongly progressive. Thus, his overall approach, emphasizing pastoral care and education within the framework of his missionary background, positions him as moderately progressive within the context of Catholic Church politics and theology.
