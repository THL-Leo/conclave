Arlindo Gomes Furtado, CSSp (born 15 November 1949) is a Cape Verdean Catholic prelate who has served as Bishop of Santiago de Cabo Verde since 2009. He was the first Bishop of Mindelo from 2004 to 2009. He studied for several years in Coimbra, Portugal, while preparing for his ordination, and several more as a professor there after becoming a priest. He is a member of the Redemptorists. Pope Francis made him a cardinal in 2015, the first from Cape Verde. Arlindo Gomes Furtado was born in 15 November 1949 in Figueira das Naus, a village of the municipality of Santa Catarina, to Ernesto Robaldo Gomes and Maria Furtado; he was baptized in August 1951. He studied at a primary school in nearby Achada Lem and by October 1962 completed his secondary education at the Seminary of São José in Praia. From 1971 to 1976, Furtado studied theology in Coimbra, Portugal. He returned to Cape Verde and was ordained a deacon on 9 May 1976 by Paulino do Livramento Évora, Bishop of Santiago. He worked at the Nossa Senhora da Graça until Bishop Evora ordained him a priest on 18 July 1976 and made him parish vicar there. From 1978 to 1986 he was rector of the Seminary of São José. From 1986 to 1990 he studied in Rome, earning a licentiate in biblical science at the Pontifical Biblical Institute. Returning to Cape Verde for a year, he worked for a year in the Lém-Cachorro and Achada São Filipe areas and then taught English at Liceu Domingos Ramos. Back in Coimbra from 1991 to 1995, he taught Greek, Hebrew, History and Biblical Geography at the Theological Studies Institute in Coimbra. He worked on translations of books of Proverbs and Ecclesiastes and published some scholarly articles and reviews. He was also a parish administrator during these years. In 1995 he returned to Cape Verde where he led the parish of Nossa Senhora da Graça once more. He became a member of the National Education Council, taught at the Police Training School, and served as vicar general of the Diocese of Santiago.

Political Analysis: Cardinal Arlindo Gomes Furtado's biography suggests a moderate leaning with a slight tilt towards progressive views within the Catholic Church's context. His educational background, with extensive studies in theology and biblical sciences in Coimbra and Rome, indicates a deep engagement with Church doctrine and an openness to scholarly and academic approaches to faith, which often correlate with a more progressive stance on interpreting scriptures and tradition. His work on translations of the books of Proverbs and Ecclesiastes and contributions to scholarly articles show an engagement with contemporary theological scholarship, further suggesting openness to new ideas within the framework of Church teachings.

His pastoral work, including his service in various parishes and his role in education (both at the Theological Studies Institute and the Police Training School), points to a commitment to pastoral care and community engagement. This involvement indicates a practical approach to faith that values social issues and reform, aligning with a more progressive outlook on the Church's role in addressing contemporary societal challenges.

Furthermore, being made a cardinal by Pope Francis, known for his relatively progressive views on social issues and Church reform, might suggest that Furtado's views are somewhat aligned with those of the Pope. However, there is no explicit evidence in the text of radical or liberal positions on Church doctrine, governance, or hot-button social issues, which justifies a moderate score with a slight lean towards progressivism rather than a clear-cut progressive or conservative classification.
