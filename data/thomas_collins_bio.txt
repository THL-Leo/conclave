Thomas Christopher Collins (born 16 January 1947) is a Canadian cardinal of the Catholic Church. He was the Metropolitan Archbishop of Toronto from 2007 to 2023, the Bishop of Saint Paul in Alberta from 1997 to 1999, and Archbishop of Edmonton from 1999 to 2006. He was elevated to the rank of Cardinal by Pope Benedict XVI on 18 February 2012. Collins was born in Guelph, Ontario, the son of George Collins, circulation manager of The Guelph Mercury, and his wife, Juliana (née Keen), a legal secretary. He has two older sisters. As a child, he was an altar server at the Our Lady Immaculate Church. He attended St. Stanislaus Elementary School and Bishop Macdonell High School, where he was inspired by one of his English teachers to join the priesthood. After earning a Bachelor of Arts degree in English from St. Jerome College, Waterloo in 1969, Collins was ordained to the diaconate on 14 May 1972. In 1973, he received a Master of Arts in English from the University of Western Ontario and a Bachelor of Theology degree from St. Peter's Seminary, London. Collins was ordained a priest for the Diocese of Hamilton, Ontario, by Bishop Paul Reding on 5 May 1973. He then served as associate pastor at Holy Rosary Parish in Burlington and at Christ the King Cathedral, as well as an English teacher and chaplain at Cathedral Boys' High School. He furthered his studies in Rome, specializing in sacred scripture at the Pontifical Biblical Institute, from which he obtained a Licentiate in Sacred Scripture in 1978. Upon his return to Ontario in 1978, Collins served as a lecturer in English at King's College and in Scripture at St. Peter's Seminary, where he later became spiritual director (1981) and associate professor of Scripture (1985). Returning to Rome, he completed a Doctorate in Sacred Theology from the Pontifical Gregorian University in 1986. His doctoral dissertation was entitled: "Apocalypse 22:6–21 as the Focal Point of Moral Teaching and Exhortation in the Apocalypse."

Political Analysis: Cardinal Thomas Christopher Collins' biography suggests a moderate conservative leaning within the Catholic Church's political spectrum. His elevation to the rank of Cardinal by Pope Benedict XVI, known for his conservative stance on doctrine and tradition, hints at Collins' alignment with traditionalist views. His extensive education in sacred scripture and theology, particularly his focus on the Apocalypse's moral teachings, indicates a deep engagement with traditional Christian doctrine. Furthermore, his roles in pastoral care and education, serving as a lecturer, spiritual director, and associate professor, suggest a commitment to conveying the Church's teachings faithfully. However, the absence of explicit mentions of controversial social issues or reforms in his biography prevents a classification of extreme conservatism. Collins' background does not explicitly address contemporary social issues or advocate for radical changes within the Church, which might have indicated a more progressive stance. Therefore, his profile suggests a conservative but not rigidly traditionalist approach, emphasizing doctrinal education and pastoral care without engaging in polarizing reforms or debates on Church governance and contemporary social issues.
