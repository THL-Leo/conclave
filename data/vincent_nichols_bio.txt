Vincent Gerard Nichols (born 8 November 1945) is an English Catholic prelate who has served as Archbishop of Westminster since 2009. He was the Archbishop of Birmingham from 2000 to 2009 and is president of the Catholic Bishops' Conference of England and Wales. He was made a cardinal in 2014. On 8 November 2020, Nichols offered his customary resignation to Pope Francis on his 75th birthday. However, the Pontiff asked him to remain on as archbishop until the appointment of a successor. The Independent Inquiry into Child Sexual Abuse has criticised Nichols for claims of lack of personal responsibility, of compassion towards victims and for allegedly prioritizing the reputation of the Church above the suffering of victims. In response, an ecclesiastical spokesperson declared that Nichols would not be resigning his cardinalate following the inquiry's criticisms, as he was "determined to put it right". Vincent Gerard Nichols was born on 8 November 1945 in Crosby, a town near Liverpool, then located in Lancashire[b] to Henry Joseph and Mary (n√©e Russell) Nichols, both teachers. He said that he felt a calling to the priesthood as a teenager. He attended St Peter and Paul's Junior School on Liverpool Road, Crosby before joining St Mary's College, Crosby, from 1956 to 1963. From St. Mary's he entered the Venerable English College, Rome. He was ordained priest for the Archdiocese of Liverpool on 21 December 1969. He obtained an STL in Theology & Philosophy from the Pontifical Gregorian University in 1970.

Political Analysis: Cardinal Vincent Gerard Nichols' political leaning within the Catholic Church context appears to lean slightly conservative, but not extremely so, suggesting a score of -0.2. His long tenure in various high-ranking positions within the Church, including Archbishop of Westminster and President of the Catholic Bishops' Conference of England and Wales, indicates a level of comfort and trust from the Vatican in his leadership and adherence to Church doctrine and tradition. The criticism from the Independent Inquiry into Child Sexual Abuse regarding his handling of abuse cases, and the emphasis on protecting the Church's reputation, further suggests a conservative approach to governance and crisis management, prioritizing institutional integrity over transparency or reform. However, the lack of specific information on his stances towards social issues, Church reform, or engagement with contemporary issues prevents a classification of Nichols as very conservative. His commitment to "put it right" in response to the inquiry's criticisms indicates some openness to addressing problems and making amends, which moderates his overall conservative leaning. Without explicit evidence of progressive theological positions or active engagement in liberal reforms within the Church, Nichols' political leaning is best described as slightly conservative, reflecting a cautious approach to change and a primary focus on maintaining Church doctrine and tradition.
