Ladislav Nemet SVD (Serbian: Ладислав Немет, Hungarian: Német László; born 7 September 1956) is a Serbian prelate of the Catholic Church who has worked in Serbia as Archbishop of Belgrade since November 2022 and before that as the Bishop of Zrenjanin[a] from 2008 to 2022. He is a member of the Society of the Divine Word (Verbites). He was made a cardinal on 7 December 2024 by Pope Francis. Before becoming a bishop he was educated and filled positions in several countries, studying in Poland and Rome, working as a missionary and pastor in the Philippines, teaching and collaborating on the Vatican's diplomatic efforts in Austria, doing pastoral work and teaching in Croatia, and then taking on several assignments in Hungary. He has credited his time in Catholic countries such as Poland and the Philippines with strengthening him for work in his episcopal assignments where he is part of a religious minority. He has been the President of the International Episcopal Conference of Saints Cyril and Methodius since 2016. Ladislav Nemet was born on 7 September 1956 in Odžaci, then in the People's Republic of Serbia, Yugoslavia, into a family of ethnic Hungarians, a significant group in the multi-ethnic Vojvodina province; Nemet refers to himself as a Hungarian.[b] His role models were a local priest and an uncle who was secretly a Verbite in Hungary under the Communists, who recommended the order as a path to broader experience, telling Nemet that "a diocese is too small for you". He attended the secondary school Gymnasium Paulinum in Subotica from 1971 to 1976. He joined the Society of the Divine Word, completed his studies in philosophy and theology in Pieniezno, Poland, and there took his perpetual vows on 8 September 1982. He received his master's degree from the Catholic University of Lublin on 7 April 1983. He was ordained a priest in Odžaci on 17 April 1983. He spent his first two years as a priest doing pastoral work in Croatia. He studied at the Pontifical Gregorian University in Rome from 1985 to 1987. While there he worked in a parish in Fiumicino and was thrilled to experience a parish of young people with an average age of 35 and with many active community groups of a sort unknown in Yugoslavia. He worked as a missionary in the Philippines and a chaplain at the University of San Carlos in Cebu City from 1987 to 1990, He later said he learned how the shortage of priests meant that "the laity do much more for the church than the official structures", something "incomprehensible" to Europeans who are "bishop and priest focused".

Political Analysis: Cardinal Ladislav Nemet's biographical text suggests a moderate leaning towards progressive views within the Catholic Church context, warranting a score of 0.3. His diverse educational and pastoral background across various countries, including his work as a missionary in the Philippines and his emphasis on the significant role of the laity in the Church, indicate a more open and inclusive approach to pastoral care and church governance. His appreciation for active community groups and the empowerment of laypeople suggests a willingness to embrace contemporary issues and potentially support reforms within the Church's structures. Additionally, his leadership in the International Episcopal Conference of Saints Cyril and Methodius and his reference to being influenced by his experiences in Catholic countries point towards a collaborative and ecumenical approach to Church governance. However, there is no explicit mention of his stance on specific doctrinal issues or hot-button social topics, which might have warranted a higher score towards progressivism. Therefore, his score reflects a moderate progressive leaning, characterized by an emphasis on pastoral care, lay participation, and ecumenical attitudes, while still operating within the broader frameworks of Church tradition and doctrine.
