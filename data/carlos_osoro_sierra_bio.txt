Carlos Osoro Sierra (Spanish pronunciation: [ˈkaɾlos oˈsoɾo ˈsjera]; born 16 May 1945) is a Spanish prelate of the Catholic Church who was Archbishop of Madrid from 2014 to 2023. He has been a bishop since 1997 and a cardinal since 2016. Osoro was born in Castañeda in northern Spain on 16 May 1945. He studied at the Escuela Normal and taught for a year in Santander. He then entered the seminary for adult vocations in Salamanca, earning licentiates in theology and philosophy at the Pontifical University of Salamanca. He later obtained a licentiate in Exact Sciences from the Complutense University of Madrid and another in pedagogy from the University of Salamanca. He was ordained a priest on 29 July 1973 by Bishop Juan Antonio de Val Gallo. He worked in a parish in Torrelavega from 1973 to 1976. He then held diocesan positions: Secretary General, Episcopal Delegate for vocations and seminaries, Episcopal Delegate for the apostolate of the laity and Vicar for pastoral care from 1976 to 1996; rector of the diocesan seminary from 1977 to 1996; vicar general from 1978 to 1992; and president of the Cathedral Chapter from 1993 to 1996. Pope John Paul II named him Bishop of Orense on 27 December 1996 and he received his episcopal consecration on 22 February 1997 from the Apostolic Nuncio to Spain Archbishop Lajos Kada. Osoro was appointed Archbishop of Oviedo on 7 January 2002 and he was installed there on 23 February. Within the Spanish Episcopal Conference he was president of the Commission for the Clergy from 1999 to 2005. Pope Benedict XVI named him Archbishop of Valencia on 8 January 2009 and he was installed there on 18 April. He was apostolic administrator of the Diocese of Santander from September 2006 to September 2007. Pope Francis named him Archbishop of Madrid on 28 August 2014. Osoro Sierra is considered to be an orthodox prelate known for his pastoral sensitivities. He participated in the synod on the family in October 2015 as one of three delegates elected by the Spanish Episcopal Conference and Pope Francis included him among the members of the Ordinary Council of the General Secretariat of the Synod of Bishops he named in November.

Political Analysis: Carlos Osoro Sierra's biography suggests a moderate to slightly progressive leaning within the Catholic Church's political spectrum. His reputation as an orthodox prelate with pastoral sensitivities indicates a commitment to Church doctrine and tradition, which might suggest a conservative stance. However, his emphasis on pastoral care, a hallmark of Pope Francis' papacy, which often involves a more inclusive and merciful approach to contentious social issues, hints at a more progressive leaning. His active participation in the synod on the family and his appointment by Pope Francis to the Ordinary Council of the General Secretariat of the Synod of Bishops further suggest an openness to engaging with contemporary issues facing the Church in a manner that is consistent with Pope Francis' more reform-oriented agenda. The absence of explicit stances on hot-button social issues or radical reforms in Church governance in the provided text prevents a classification of Osoro as strongly progressive. Therefore, a score of 0.3 is appropriate, reflecting a position that is moderate with slight progressive tendencies, particularly in the context of pastoral care and engagement with contemporary issues under the guidance of Pope Francis.
