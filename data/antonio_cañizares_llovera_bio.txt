He was made a cardinal in 2006. Antonio Cañizares was born in Utiel, and studied at the minor and major seminaries in Valencia and at the Pontifical University of Salamanca, from where he obtained his doctorate in theology, specializing in catechesis. He was ordained to the priesthood by Archbishop José García Lahiguera on 21 June 1970, and then served as assistant pastor and delegate for catechesis in the Archdiocese of Valencia. Following his transfer to the Archdiocese of Madrid, Cañizares taught catechetical theology at the University of Salamanca and fundamental theology at the Conciliar Seminary of Madrid. He later became the director and a professor of the Institute of Religious Science and Catechesis in Madrid, and sat on several commissions and secretariats of the Spanish Episcopal Conference as well. From 1985 to 1992, Cañizares served as director of the Secretariat of the Episcopal Commission for the Doctrine of the Faith. He also founded and was the first president of Asociación Española de Catequistas, and was Director of the review Teología y Catequesis. On 6 March 1992, Cañizares was appointed Bishop of Ávila by Pope John Paul II. He received his episcopal consecration on the following 25 April from Archbishop Mario Tagliaferri, with Cardinals Ángel Suquía Goicoechea and Marcelo González Martín serving as co-consecrators, in the Cathedral of Ávila. Cañizares Llovera later became a member of the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith in the Roman Curia on 10 November 1996, and was named Archbishop of Granada on 10 December of that same year. In addition to his duties in Granada, he was Apostolic Administrator of Cartagena from January to October 1998, and was elected President of the Episcopal Commission of Education and Catechesis in 1999. Cañizares Llovera was promoted to Archbishop of Toledo and Primate of Spain on 24 October 2002 by Pope John Paul II. He was elected vice-president of the Spanish Episcopal Conference as well.

Political Analysis: Antonio Cañizares Llovera's career and positions within the Catholic Church suggest a conservative or traditionalist leaning. His roles, particularly as prefect of the Congregation for Divine Worship and the Discipline of the Sacraments and his involvement with the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith, indicate a strong commitment to maintaining and enforcing Church doctrine and liturgical tradition. These congregations are key in preserving the Church's teachings and practices, often resisting liberal reforms. His leadership in catechesis, both in educational roles and within the Episcopal Commission for the Doctrine of the Faith, further underscores his focus on traditional Catholic education and doctrine. Additionally, being appointed and promoted by Popes John Paul II and Benedict XVI, both of whom were known for their conservative stances on doctrinal and moral issues, suggests alignment with their theological and ecclesiastical orientations. While the text does not provide explicit details on his views on social issues, governance, or engagement with contemporary issues, his prominent positions in the Church's doctrinal and liturgical offices imply a preference for traditionalism over progressive reform.
