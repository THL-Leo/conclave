Carlos Gustavo Castillo Mattasoglio (born 28 February 1950) is a Peruvian prelate of the Catholic Church whom Pope Francis named Archbishop of Lima on 25 January 2019 and made a cardinal on 7 December 2024. From completing his training in theology in 1987 until his episcopal appointment, he devoted himself to both pastoral care and theological education in Peru. Carlos Castillo Mattasoglio was born in Lima on 28 February 1950. After attending the Dalton de Lince College and the San Agustín College of Lima, he studied at the National University of San Marcos from 1968 to 1973, earning a bachelor's degree in social sciences. At San Marcos, he joined the National Union of Catholic Students, led by Father Gustavo Gutiérrez, one of the principal voices in the Liberation Theology movement. He continued his studies at the Santo Toribio di Mogrovejo major seminary in Lima. At the Pontifical Gregorian University in Rome he earned a bachelor's degrees in philosophy in 1979 and in theology in 1983. He was ordained a priest for the Archdiocese of Lima on 15 July 1984 by Cardinal Juan Landázuri Ricketts. He obtained a licentiate and a doctorate in dogmatic theology in 1985 and 1987 at the Gregorian. He returned to Peru in 1987. He was assessor of the National Union of Catholic Students from 1987 to 1998, the vicar of various parishes from 1987 to 1991, and then an associate in parish work from 1991 to 1999, and a vicar again from 1999 to 2015. He has been a lecturer in Catholic theology at the Pontifical Catholic University of Peru since 1987. Castillo, along with every other faculty member at its Theology Department, was suspended by Cardinal Juan Luis Cipriani Thorne in 2013 amid a conflict between Cipriani and the university administration. After that, Castillo continued teaching courses in morals and Christian social thought. In 2016, the university's new Great Chancellor Cardinal Giuseppe Versaldi renewed the licenses to teach Catholic theology of Castillo and the other faculty. He headed university pastoral care in Lima in the 1990s and held a variety of archdiocesan posts with responsibility for youth and vocational pastoral care from 1996 to 1999. On the national level, he was assessor of the Commission for Youth of the Peruvian Episcopal Conference from 1990 to 2001. He was director of relations with the Church and a member of the University Council of the Pontifical Catholic University of Peru from 2003 to 2006.

Political Analysis: Carlos Gustavo Castillo Mattasoglio's biography indicates a strong leaning towards the liberal/progressive end of the spectrum within the Catholic Church's context. His early involvement with the National Union of Catholic Students under the leadership of Father Gustavo Gutiérrez, a key figure in the Liberation Theology movement, suggests a foundational influence of progressive theological and social perspectives. Liberation Theology itself, with its emphasis on social justice and the preferential option for the poor, is often associated with more progressive stances within the Church. Furthermore, Castillo's academic pursuits, culminating in a doctorate in dogmatic theology, and his continued commitment to teaching Catholic theology, even after being suspended amid conflicts over theological directions, demonstrate a dedication to engaging with contemporary theological debates. His roles in pastoral care, especially with youth and vocational pastoral care, and his involvement at the national level with the Commission for Youth of the Peruvian Episcopal Conference, suggest a pastoral approach that is responsive to current societal issues and the needs of the faithful, aligning with more progressive pastoral practices. Additionally, the conflict with Cardinal Juan Luis Cipriani Thorne, known for his conservative stance, and Castillo's subsequent reinstatement by Cardinal Giuseppe Versaldi, hint at Castillo's alignment with theological and ecclesiastical positions that are more open and reformist. Given these factors, Castillo's political leaning within the Church is assessed as significantly liberal/progressive.
