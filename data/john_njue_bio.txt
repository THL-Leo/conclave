John Njue (born 1 January 1946) is a Kenyan cardinal of the Catholic Church. He was the fourth Archbishop of Nairobi from 2007 to 2021. He previously served as Coadjutor Archbishop of Nyeri from 2002 to 2007 and Bishop of Embu from 1986 to 2002. He was elevated to the rank of cardinal in 2007. Njue was born in Embu, Kenya, on 1 January 1946[a] to Joseph Nyanga Kibariki and Monica Ngina Nyaga. He was baptized in 1948 and entered the minor seminary in Nkubu in 1962. From 1967 to 1974, he furthered his studies in Rome at the Pontifical Urbaniana University (where he obtained a licentiate in philosophy) and Pontifical Lateran University (licentiate in pastoral theology). On 6 January 1973, Njue was ordained to the priesthood by Pope Paul VI in St. Peter's Basilica. Returning to Kenya in October 1974, he did pastoral work in Kariakomu in the southern district of Meru. He also taught philosophy at the National Seminary of Bungoma, of which he later served as rector from 1978 to 1982. In 1982, he completed a course in spirituality in the United States. He then served as a parish priest in Chuka and rector of the Philosophical Seminary of Meru. On 9 June 1986, Njue was appointed Bishop of Embu by Pope John Paul II. He received his episcopal consecration on the following 20 September from Jozef Cardinal Tomko, the co-consecrators being Bishops Silas Silvius Njiru and Raphael Ndingi Mwana'a Nzeki. He served as President of the Kenyan Episcopal Conference from 1997 to 2003 and was named Coadjutor Archbishop of Nyeri on 23 January 2002. Following the murder of Bishop Luigi Locati, he served as Apostolic Administrator of Isolo from 2005 to 2006. Njue was appointed Archbishop of Nairobi on 6 October 2007 and was installed on the following 1 November. Shortly afterwards, he was created Cardinal-Priest of Preziosissimo Sangue di Nostro Signore Ges√π Cristo by Pope Benedict XVI in the consistory of 24 November 2007. On 12 June 2008 he was named a member of the Congregation for the Evangelization of Peoples and the Congregation for the Clergy. On 29 December 2011 he was appointed a member of the Pontifical Council for Social Communications for a five-year renewable term. Cardinal Njue serves as Vice President of the International Catholic Migration Commission.

Political Analysis: Cardinal John Njue's biographical details suggest a leaning towards the conservative/traditionalist side of the spectrum within the Catholic Church's context. His education at Pontifical universities, known for their adherence to traditional Catholic theology and philosophy, and his ordination by Pope Paul VI, a pontiff who navigated the Church through the immediate post-Vatican II era while maintaining a cautious approach to reforms, set a foundation for a conservative outlook. His roles and appointments further underline this orientation. Serving as President of the Kenyan Episcopal Conference, being appointed by Pope John Paul II (noted for his conservative stance on doctrinal matters), and being created Cardinal by Pope Benedict XVI (also known for his conservative theological positions) align him with figures and periods in the Church that emphasized continuity over radical change. His membership in the Congregation for the Evangelization of Peoples and the Congregation for the Clergy, as well as the Pontifical Council for Social Communications, positions him within influential Vatican bodies that oversee doctrine, clergy discipline, and the Church's engagement with society, suggesting a role in maintaining traditional doctrinal and moral teachings. Additionally, his vice presidency of the International Catholic Migration Commission, while indicating engagement with contemporary social issues, does not necessarily imply a liberal stance, as the Church's teaching on migration has consistently emphasized human dignity and rights within a framework that can be embraced across the spectrum. The absence of specific mentions of advocacy for doctrinal changes, engagement with progressive movements within the Church, or outspoken support for reforms related to contentious issues (e.g., ordination of women, LGBTQ+ rights, clerical celibacy) further supports a conservative classification. Therefore, a score of -0.7 is reflective of a predominantly conservative orientation, acknowledging some engagement with social issues within a traditional doctrinal framework.
