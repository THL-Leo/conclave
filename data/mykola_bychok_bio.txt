Mykola Bychok, C.Ss.R. (Ukrainian: Микола Бичок; born 13 February 1980) is a Ukrainian Greek Catholic[a] prelate who has served as Eparch of Saints Peter and Paul of Melbourne, Australia since 2020. Pope Francis made him a cardinal on 7 December 2024, making him the youngest member of the College of Cardinals and youngest elector in the 2025 papal conclave. He is a member of the Redemptorists. Bychok was born in Ternopil in western Ukraine in 1980. He joined the Congregation of the Most Holy Redeemer, popularly known as the Redemptorists, in July 1997. His religious training took place in Ukraine and Poland, where he obtained a licentiate in pastoral theology. On 17 August 2003, Bychok took his religious vows, and on 3 May 2005 he was ordained a priest in the Ukrainian Catholic Archeparchy of Lviv. Following his ordination, Bychok spent time as a missionary at the Mother of Perpetual Help Church in Prokopyevsk, Russia. He later served as the superior of Saint Joseph's Redemptorists Monastery and pastor of the Mother Parish of Perpetual Help in Ivano-Frankivsk, Ukraine. From 2015 to 2020 Bychok served as the vicar of the Ukrainian Catholic parish of Saint John the Baptist in Newark, New Jersey, US, part of the Archieparchy of Philadelphia of the Ukrainians. On 15 January 2020, he was appointed by Pope Francis as the eparchial bishop of the Ukrainian Catholic Eparchy of Saints Peter and Paul of Melbourne, succeeding Peter Stasiuk. The eparchy's jurisdiction comprises Australia, New Zealand, and Oceania. On 7 June 2020, the feast of Pentecost in the Julian calendar used by the Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church at the time, he was consecrated as bishop by Major Archbishop Sviatoslav Shevchuk and other hierarchs of the Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church in St. George's Cathedral, Lviv.

Political Analysis: Cardinal Mykola Bychok's biography suggests a moderate leaning with a slight tilt towards conservatism within the Catholic Church's political spectrum. His membership and active role in the Redemptorists, a congregation known for its missionary work and emphasis on preaching the Gospel, indicate a strong commitment to traditional pastoral care and evangelization. His education in pastoral theology and subsequent missionary activities, including his time in Russia and leadership roles within the Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church, underscore a dedication to the Church's spiritual and social missions within a traditional framework.

The fact that he was appointed by Pope Francis, known for his more progressive appointments, might suggest an openness to reform or at least a balance between tradition and contemporary issues. However, there is no explicit mention of Bychok advocating for significant doctrinal changes, engaging in liberal social reforms, or pushing for radical shifts in Church governance. His consecration on a significant feast day in the Julian calendar and his leadership roles within the context of the Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church, which maintains a distinct liturgical tradition while being in communion with Rome, further highlight a respect for tradition.

Given the lack of explicit evidence pointing towards radical reformist views or a strong conservative stance against changes within the Church, Bychok appears to represent a moderate position. His background suggests a slight conservative leaning due to a strong emphasis on mission work, pastoral care, and leadership within a traditional ecclesiastical structure, hence the score of -0.2.
