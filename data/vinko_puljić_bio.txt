Vinko Puljić (pronounced [ʋîːŋko pǔːʎit͜ɕ]; born 8 September 1945) is a Bosnian Croat prelate of the Catholic Church who has been a cardinal since 1994. He was the archbishop of Vrhbosna from 1991 to 2022. The twelfth of thirteen children, Vinko Puljić was born in Banja Luka, Bosnia and Herzegovina (then part of Yugoslavia), to Ivan and Kaja Puljić. His mother died when he was three years old, and his father then remarried. In addition to his family, young Vinko's spiritual formation was deeply influenced by the Trappist Mariastern Abbey, located not far from his native village. One of the monks helped Vinko's father to send his son to the minor seminary of Zagreb. Father Ante Artner sold his motorbike and gave the proceeds to Vinko's father, who did not have enough money to pay his board there. Vinko then studied philosophy and theology at the major seminary of Đakovo. Puljić was ordained to the priesthood by Bishop Stjepan Bauerlein on 29 June 1970, and then served as a chaplain in the Diocese of Banja Luka until 1973, whence he became an official of the diocesan curia. He was a parish priest in Sasina from June to November 1973, and in Ravska from 1973 to 1978. In 1978, he was named spiritual director of the minor seminary of Zadar. During this time, he also served as a confessor at a Benedictine monastery and organised spiritual retreats for priests, seminarians, and nuns. In 1987, he returned to the Diocese of Banja Luka, where he served as a parish priest in Bosanska Gradiška. He was later transferred to Sarajevo in 1990 as vice-rector of the Sarajevo major seminary. On 19 November 1990, Puljić was appointed Archbishop of Vrhbosna by Pope John Paul II. He thus became the sixth archbishop of that see after the reconstruction of the ordinary ecclesiastical hierarchy in 1881, after the Ottoman occupational rule which had lasted more than four centuries. He received his episcopal consecration on 6 January 1991 from John Paul II himself, with archbishops Giovanni Battista Re and Justin Francis Rigali serving as co-consecrators, at St. Peter's Basilica.

Political Analysis: Cardinal Vinko Puljić's biography suggests a leaning towards the conservative/traditionalist side of the spectrum within the Catholic Church's political context. His deep spiritual formation influenced by the Trappist Mariastern Abbey, a community known for its adherence to the contemplative life and strict observance of the Rule of St. Benedict, points towards a foundation in traditional Catholic spirituality and monastic discipline. His decision to enter the priesthood, along with his educational path through seminary studies in philosophy and theology, further aligns with a traditional vocational journey within the Church.

Puljić's pastoral and clerical roles, including service as a chaplain, parish priest, spiritual director of a seminary, and confessor at a Benedictine monastery, reflect a career deeply embedded in the pastoral and spiritual care of the faithful, emphasizing roles that are traditionally conservative in nature within the Church's hierarchy. His organization of spiritual retreats for priests, seminarians, and nuns indicates a commitment to fostering traditional spiritual and religious formation.

His appointment as Archbishop of Vrhbosna by Pope John Paul II, a pope known for his conservative stance on doctrinal matters, and receiving episcopal consecration directly from him, could also suggest alignment with conservative elements within the Church, given the significance of papal appointments in reflecting and shaping the ideological leanings of the Church's hierarchy.

The text does not provide explicit details on Puljić's views on social issues, reform, or engagement with contemporary issues, which could further inform his political leaning. However, based on the available information regarding his background, formation, and roles within the Church, it is reasonable to infer a conservative/traditionalist orientation in his approach to Church doctrine, tradition, and governance.
