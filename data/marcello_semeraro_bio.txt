Marcello Semeraro (born 22 December 1947) is an Italian prelate of the Catholic Church who has been the Prefect of the Congregation for the Causes of Saints since October 2020. He was previously Bishop of Albano and secretary to the group of cardinals named by Pope Francis to advise him. Pope Francis raised him to the rank of cardinal on 28 November 2020. Semeraro was born in Monteroni di Lecce, Province of Lecce, Italy. He was ordained to the priesthood on 8 September 1971. He received his Doctor of Theology degree in 1980 from the Pontifical Lateran University. On 25 July 1998 he was named Bishop of Oria. He was consecrated on 29 September 1998 by Archbishop Cosmo Francesco Ruppi with Archbishops Domenico Caliandro and Donato Negro as co-consecrators. He taught at the Pontifical Lateran University in 2001. Pope John Paul II chose him as Special Secretary of the 2001 Synod of Bishops, which considered the role of the bishops in contemporary society. That Synod's final statement pointed to social injustice as the root cause of terrorism and decried third world debt and "the enduring drama of hunger and extreme poverty". Semeraro commented: "There is a strong will to dismantle the image of bishops as men of power and to reinstitute the image of bishops as men of service." On 1 October 2004 he was named Bishop of Albano.

Political Analysis: Cardinal Marcello Semeraro's biography suggests a leaning towards the liberal/progressive end of the spectrum within the context of Catholic Church politics and theology. His close association with Pope Francis, known for his relatively progressive views on social issues and Church reform, as a secretary to the advisory group of cardinals, indicates an alignment with the Pope's vision for the Church. Semeraro's involvement in the 2001 Synod of Bishops, which emphasized social justice issues such as poverty, hunger, and the critique of third-world debt, further underscores his progressive stance on social issues. The Synod's final statement, which he commented on, aimed to shift the perception of bishops from figures of power to servants, aligning with a more pastoral, service-oriented approach to Church leadership. This perspective, along with his academic and pastoral background, suggests a preference for a Church that engages actively with contemporary issues, emphasizes social justice, and seeks to reform its image and practices to be more inclusive and service-oriented. Therefore, his political leaning within the Church is assessed as significantly progressive, though not at the extreme end of the spectrum, given the broad range of views within the Church.
